            Thursday-Saturday, August 2-4, 2001
                          at the

     ** Abstract submission deadline:  June  1, 2001 **

Yet Another Perl Conference (YAPC) is an inexpensive (< 100 EURO) Perl
users and developers conference, with a mix of tutorials and
technical talks. The conference is set in Amsterdam, The Netherlands.

YAPC began as a grassroots users conference, from discussions
among Perl Mongers, and has grown from there.  We would like
to invite you to join us for three days of Perl, people, and
demonstrations, at a price that shouldn't hurt your wallet.
There will be a limit of around 500 people for the conference.

A number of members of the Perl community are contributing to this
event.

Look at the main web page for more details --

  *********** CALL FOR PAPERS ***********

Potential presenters should submit a 200-300 word abstract to

        papers@yapceurope.org

in plain ASCII text or HTML by June 1st for consideration.
We would like your materials to be available online, but
that is not required.  If you have materials to include in
the proceedings, or course notes, please let us know of your
requirements in the abstract. If you have any special
presentation needs, please include them also.

The conference theme will be Security, so a portion of the the
talks will be about that subject in some way. So if you have some
knowledge of Perl related security issues, or use Perl in security
related areas, you're more then welcome to share this with fellow
Perl users at the conferece.

Suggestions :

*	writing secure Perl CGI programs
*	security bloopers
*	cryptography techniques
*	cryptography applications
*	security issues in past and coming versions of perl
*	How you use Perl to enhance security of your network or website
*	Modules useful in security
*	Whatever you find interesting that's Perl- and security related


A part of the time will be available for other Perl related subjects.
Suggestions for subjects:

*	Groupware, Agents, and Bots
*	Perl in the world of Windows
*	MacPerl
*	Perl for Speech and Language
*	Text and Document Processing
*	Machine Learning in Perl
*	HTML, XML, and Markup Languages
*	CGI and Web programming in Perl
*	Internet Programming
*	Database Interaction and Access with Perl
*	Scientific Computing (e.g. with PDL)
*	Practical Perl Programming
*	Module guts and usage on any particular Module.
*	Tutorials of all stripes: Modules, Objects, CPAN
*	Visionary or position papers on Perl, the past,
       the present, and the future
*	Anything cool :)

We have the following time slots in our schedule, so your
contribution could have one of the following durations:

180 minute tutorials
90 minute talks
40 minute talks
25 minute talks
lightning talks (5 minutes)


Conference fees will be waived for presenters at yapc
(lightning talks excepted), so another way to reduce your
costs is to give a good talk on something you're excited about.


We are looking for sponsors. Please contact Liz and Eric
(sponsor@yapceurope.org) for information about how you can help
support YAPC Europe. Much of the necessary funding for YAPC
comes from the generous donations of our sponsors.
