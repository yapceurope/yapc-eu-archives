	This tutorial will present a carefully selected minimal
	subset of Perl that gives immediate access to some of
	its powerful capabilities and serves as a solid foundation
	for additional learning.
	The target audience is non-programmers who want to learn
	simple data processing tasks without learning too much
	and programmers who already know another language and
	want to learn just enough Perl to gain access to some of 
	its capabilities.

<strong><em>Bondage and Discipline, or Strict beyond strict.pm</em>
	<br>by <a href="bio.html#schwern">Michael G Schwern</a>, Just
	Another Stupid Company</strong><br>
	There are several techniques for searching out questionable
	code ranging from overriding core functions, filters and
	using the infamous backend compiler (B modules).  This talk
	will go over some of the things to look for--sloppy and
	insecure use of files, truly private methods, hashes with
	fixed keysets, type-safe code--and how to look for them
	before the code is ever run.

<strong><em>DNSSEC and extensions to Net::DNS</em>
	<br>by Olaf Kolkman, RIPE NCC</strong><br>
	The Domain Name System (DNS) is a critical part of the Internet
	Infrastructure, but the original design did not take the
	security threads that exist on the current Internet into 
	account.  Within the IETF people have been adding security
	extensions to the DNS protocol (DNSSEC, RFC2535).  Some
	groups have started to work and experiment with deployment
	of DNSSEC, which has led to the realization that there is
	a strong need for tools.  RIPE NCC is using Michael
	Fuhr's Net::DNS package and extending it with the DNSSEC
	features needed to build tools.
	This talk will present a small
	overview of DNSSEC and give an example of the use of
	the Net::DNS security extensions.
<p><a name="69"></a>
<strong><em>Perl and Network Intrusion Detection Systems -- a 
	summary and perspective</em>
	<br>by Scott A. McIntyre, XS4ALL Internet B.V.</strong><br>
	This will consist of a brief discussion of Perl-based
	applications and utilities to aid in network intrusion
	detection systems and applications.  Popular applications
	for host-based NIDS and statistical programs for analyzing
	larger amounts of data will be covered, along with a real
	world example of the role Perl has played in a government
	research organization's use of NIDS.
<p><a name="53"></a>
<strong><em><a href="http://www.itsx.com/talks/yapc2001">Perl 
as a hacking tool</a></em>
	<br>by Stephanie Wehner, ITSX</strong><br>
	Perl can be a great help in penetration testing, from
	simple examples such as upload and retrieval tools to
	more complex tools such as ITSX's Perl module which works
	with FreeBSD's divert sockets, using Perl's text processing
	capabilities to alter packets on the fly.
<p><a name="49"></a>
<strong><em>Safe Serialization - The Pitfalls of Persistence</em>
	<br>by Jonathan Stowe</strong><br>
	Serialization--the rendering of data objects in a format that
	can be made persistent--is becoming increasingly common in
	modern software applications.  The fact that the program that
	recreates the object doesn't need to know the creation
	circumstances is at the root of a potential security
	concern: a program could be vulnerable to malicious or
	badly created data.  A particular instance of the vulnerability
	and a scheme for mitigation will be presented.
<p><a name="70"></a>
<strong><em>Security Bloopers</em>
	<br>by Jan-Pieter Cornet, XS4ALL Internet B.V. and
	Antony Antony</strong><br>
	Security is not easy; even experienced, security-minded people
	can make mistakes.  Some such bloopers will be revealed in this
	talk.
<p><a name="54"></a>
<strong><em><a href="54/index.html">Security-aware 
programming with Perl</a></em>
	<br>by <a href="bio.html#vet">Arjan de Vet</a>, Madison 
Gurkha</strong><br>
	More and more security vulnerabilities arise due to badly
	written applications which can often be forced into doing
	things they were not supposed to do.  Many of these applications
	are written in Perl, especially on web sites.  This talk
	will discuss examples of past security problems in Perl
	scripts, discuss hints and tips in avoiding security problems
	and show how Perl can help you avoid security problems--to
	a certain extent.
<p><a name="28"></a>
<strong><em><a href="28/index.html">Tainting and Regexes</a></em>
	<br>by Hugo van der Sanden</strong><br>
	This talk will build up to code which applies a security
	policy to Perl scripts.

<strong><em>12 Step Perl</em>
	<br>by Piers Cawley, Iterative Software Ltd.</strong><br>
	Have <strong>you</strong> ever written a chunk of 'real life'
	code and found yourself thinking &quot;If I changed that
	bit there, and that bit, I'll have a JAPH to rival Abigail&quot;?
	Have you ever used a complicated Schwartzian Transform to
	sort an array that was never going to have more than 10
	elements?  You have?  Come to the supportive environment
	that is Manglers' Anonymous.

<strong><em><a href="35/index.html">AxKit -- 
integrated XML processing solution</a></em>
	<br>by Jan Pazdziora, Masaryk University, Brno, 
Czech Republic</strong><br>
	AxKit is a package integrating flexible XML processing management
	into an Apache/mod_perl environment.  This presentation will
	introduce the AxKit architecture and steps that are done
	during a data processing.  If you are not familiar with
	AxKit, this talk serves as an introduction for the material
	presented in
	<em>Data Layer in Dynamic Applications and Presentation
	Formatting</em>.
<p><a name="30"></a>
<strong><em><a href="30/index.html">Data Layer in Dynamic Applications 
and Presentation 
	Formatting</a></em>
	<br>by Jan Pazdziora, Masaryk University, Brno, Czech 
Republic</strong><br>
	To achieve multiple user designs and page layouts of web
	applications, including output for paper media or handheld
	devices from one code base, the data must have a well defined
	and described structure.  The approach presented is aimed at
	large systems with hundreds of applications where embedding
	the code into HTML markup leads to unmanageable setup and
	code lost in formatting details.
	As the markup is not produced by function calls in applications
	but rendered in a single place using fast XSLT transformers,
	the performance is comparable with templating approaches.
	This talk assumes a basic knowledge of AxKit; <em>AxKit -- 
	integrated XML processing solution</em> serves as an introduction
	to this speech for anyone unfamiliar with AxKit.

<strong><em>e-smith server and gateway</em>
	<br>by Kirrily &quot;Skud&quot; Robert</strong><br>
	The e-smith server and gateway is a specialized Linux distribution
	suitable for small-to-medium enterprises or home networks.  One
	of its great strengths is its modular, extensible architecture,
	which uses Perl to trigger events and actions, expand templated
	configuration files, generate a sophisticated web-based administration
	system, and more.  As seen at
	<a href="http://www.perl.com/pub/2001/02/esmith.html">perl.com</a>.

<strong><em>GCC XML Node introspector Project in Perl</em>
	<br>by Michael Dupont, MCI Worldcom GmbH</strong><br>
 	The goal of the
	<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/introspector">GCC 
	XML Node introspector project</a> is to extract the
	intermediate representation of the GNU Compiler nodes into
	XML and then be able to access this information at runtime
	when needed by a program.  Perl is the prototyping and
	testing tool for the project and has played an important
	role for a number of reasons.  This talk will consist
	of an overview of the project, graphs, sample source
	code, and an overview of other projects working on 
	similar goals which shows how unique this project is.
<p><a name="40"></a>
<strong><em>Handling Attributes</em>
	<br>by <a href="bio.html#grunauer">Marcel Grunauer</a></strong><br>
	Although new and experimental in recent versions of Perl,
	attributes are going to play a big role as Perl 6 properties.
	This talk will discuss the concept, show what attributes are
	useful for, cover how to develop your own attributes and give
	a brief outlook on Perl 6 properties.
<p><a name="20"></a>
<strong><em>Instant Compilers</em>
	<br>by L&eacute;on Brocard, Iterative Software</strong><br>
	This talk will explain how to use either the Parse::Yapp or 
	Parse::RecDescent modules to construct an optimizing
	interpreter and then an optimizing compiler for a
	simple Perl-like toy language, much like the Template
	Toolkit does.
<p><a name="51"></a>
<strong><em>Interpreter based thread (ithreads)</em>
	<br>by Artur &quot;sky&quot; Bergman, Contiller AB</strong><br>
	This talk includes a short history of Perl and thread,
	including why 5005threads were considered a failure and
	why multiplicity and ithreads were developed; how to use
	the ithread module to create, manage and destroy threads; and
	the pitfalls with threads in perl and the changes to that
	have been made to the regex engine to make threads work.

<p><a name="l"></a>
<strong><em>Lightning talks hosted by L&eacute;on Brocard</em></strong><br>
	Lightning talks consist of a series of 5-minute talks.
	This session will include:
	<ul>
	<li><a href="bio.html#cross">Dave Cross</a> explaining why the
	generally accepted wisdom that Perl advocacy is a Good Thing is
	off the mark in <em>Why Perl Advocacy Is a Bad Idea</em>;</li>

<strong><em><a href="14/index.html">Mail::Box</a></em>
	<br>by Mark Overmeer, AT Computing</strong><br>
	The Mail::Box module is meant to replace the popular Mail::Folder
	with a more modern implementation of a Mail User Agent back-end.
	The talk will discuss how autoloading on data is used to
	transparently implement the delayed parsing of messages.
	This talk may be of interest even to more trained Perl-programmers
	because this way of autoloading, although less frequently used,
	has great potential.
<p><a name="45"></a>
<strong><em>Making Stone Soup</em>
	<br>by Greg McCarroll</strong><br>
	There is an old story about beggars who were making soup
	but put stones in.  This story was the basis for examining
	the problem with Perl.
	When building beggar objects you can learn different ways
	to improve their chances of getting more out of the deal and
	they can learn over time and develop trust relationships with
	other beggars.  You can also put different beggar objects
	together in a simulation to see how they adapt.
<p><a name="33"></a>
<strong><em><a href="33/modperl2.html">mod_perl 2.0</a></em>
	<br>by Gerald Richter, ecos gmbh</strong><br>
	Following a short introduction to mod_perl this talk will
	provide an overview of what's new in version 2.0-dev and what
	else is planned for the future.  Learn how mod_perl-2.0 has
	adjusted to Apache 2.0's threaded architecture using new
	features in Perl 5.6.0 to provide significant improvements
	over 1.xx versions.  This session will also discuss how and
	where mod_perl fits in the new APIs and module hooks introduced
	in Apache 2.0.
<p><a name="18"></a>
<strong><em><a href="18/index.html">Mutagenic modules</a></em>
	<br>by Robin Houston, Kitsite Ltd.</strong><br>
	Perl modules can change the meaning of subsequent code in some way.
	Pragmas such as 'use integer' alter meaning in this way but
	require significant co-operation from the interpreter.  However,
	there are many ways you can write your own &quot;mutagenic
	modules&quot;.
<p><a name="3"></a>
<strong><em>organizing sound with Perl</em>
	<br>by Alex McLean</strong><br>
	The talk will consist of performing music live while explaining
	how it was done.  Topics include subjects such as generative
	music, map-based composition, polyrhythms, realtime parametrical
	control over compositional processes, sonifying common algorithms,
	finding beauty in data through sonic transformations, and why
	Perl is so suitable for making music.  This talk will differ
	from last year's YAPC::Europe talk in that there will be more
	focus on demonstration and explanation.
<p><a name="52"></a>
<strong><em>POE</em>
	<br>by Artur &quot;sky&quot; Bergman, Contiller AB</strong><br>
        POE is a framework for building Perl programs that lends
	itself naturally to tasks which involve reacting to external
	data, such as network communications or user interfaces.  This
	speech will describe event loops, POE, how to write a small
	network application using POE, examples of what POE has been
	used for, and the history of POE.
<p><a name="39"></a>
<strong><em><a href="39/index.html">Parallel 
Processing with Perl and PVM</a></em>
	<br>by Benjamin Holzman, Longitude, Inc.</strong><br>
	One way of dealing with performance issues is to distribute
	work among multiple processors.  There are many different
	ways to do this. The Parallel Virtual Machine (PVM) architecture
	and API  takes care of all the details of starting servers,
	maintaining network connections and marshaling
	and demarshaling data between heterogeneous
	platforms.  A sample program involving coarse-grained
	parallelism will be introduced and a single-process implementation
	converted into a distributed program using PVM.

        The Inline module allows you to put source code from other
        programming languages directly "inline" in a Perl script or
        module. The code is automatically compiled as needed, and then
        loaded for immediate access from Perl. Various aspects of

	This talk will propose ways to increase Perl usage using
	a combination of legal and technological means.  Two main
	areas that will help achieve our aims: disability legislation

	<br>by Alex Gough</strong><br>
	The Quantum::Entanglement module attempts to &quot;port&quot;
	some of the functionality of the universe into perl.  This
	talk will not feature maths but will instead concentrate on fuzzy
	principles and their application in Perl.

<strong><em>Reefknot</em>
	<br>by Kirrily &quot;Skud&quot; Robert</strong><br>
	The Reefknot project is an attempt to create a toolkit for
	developing RFC-compliant calendaring and scheduling applications
	in Perl.  The Reefknot project's first task has been to
	reimplement Net::ICal in pure, idiomatic Perl.  The next
	step will be to allow programmers to avoid most of the
	tedium of calendar-parsing by creating more abstract
	interfaces.  It is the hope of the team that people will
	be able to use Reefknot to easily create calendar and
	scheduling systems.

<strong><em>Scripting Perl applications using JavaScript.pm</em>
	<br>by Claes Jacobsson, Contiller AB</strong><br>
	The JavaScript.pm module incorporates the SpiderMonkey JS
	engine into Perl and provides a simple API for developers
	so that they can run JS code within their applications.
	This talk will cover what the JavaScript.pm module is capable
	of, why to use JavaScript.pm, how to use JavaScript.pm,
	security aspects, and future ideas and improvements, such
	as an Inline version.

<strong><em><a href="4/index.html">Strict to porter - How use strict made me a 
	perl5-porter</a></em>
	<br>by H. Merijn Brand</strong><br>
	Being faced with an apparently simple problem of converting
	a list of plain data to a report, the author wrote a
	solution which worked well and was developed further--until
	the script wouldn't compile.
	This talk will deal with why symbolic links were chosen for
	a project, what the impact of 'use strict;' was to the script,
	and what eventually made the author find the location in the
	Perl guts that caused the problem.

<strong><em><a href="37/index.html">Wax::On Wax::Off</a></em>
	<br>by Mark Fowler, Profero and Richard Clamp</strong><br>
	Instruction of computer programming is problem solving
	transfer.  How do we teach this ability?  Most teaching
	places too much emphasis on syntax.  Using the metaphors
	of the Kung Fu movie, this talk takes a look
	at &quot;when to bonk your student on the head and
	when not to&quot;, &quot;reading the secret manual&quot;
	and &quot;combining styles&quot;.  This is a light-hearted
	look at an important day-to-day issue in your Perl team.
