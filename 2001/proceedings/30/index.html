<H2>Data layer in dynamic applications and presentation formatting</H2>

<H3><I>Jan Pazdziora</I></H3>

<P>Scheduled: Iterative Software room on Friday at 16:20-17:00 (paper # 30)</P>

<P>
<B>Abstract:</B> To achieve multiple user designs and page layouts of Web
applications, including output for paper media or handheld devices
from one code base, the structure of the data must be well defined
and described. It can then be transparently filled with output
structures of mod_perl/Apache::Registry handlers, producing XML data
output. Using AxKit, a series of transformations can be applied to
this XML data, producing various outputs depending on many factors.
</P>

<P>
The approach presented is aimed at large systems with hundreds of
applications where embedding the code into HTML markup leads to
unmanageable setup and code lost inside of formatting details. The
handlers are run in mod_perl environment and return only Perl
hashes, programmers are not slowed down by generating HTML tags.
XML data stream is created on the fly, available for logging,
auditing or testing, and XSLT and other transformations produce
client-friendly formatting on the server side.
</P>

<P>
As the markup is not produced by function calls in applications
but rather rendered in single place, using fast XSLT transformers,
the performance is comparable with templating approaches, but with
data being strictly separated from presentation. The approach allows
using the applications as Web enabled components using for example
SOAP, and to combine them together, suitable for toolbars or
sideboxes. Multilingual pages can be served without any language
specific code in individual applications, thanks to dynamic
processing offered by AxKit.

<H3>Single presentation point for hundreds of applications</H3>

<P>
Information system of my university consists of over 300 perl scripts
run in mod_perl environment. We are happy with having the applications
isolated into individual files that can be used immediately when copied
into proper directory tree. But we feel we need more flexibility in
creating and maintaining consistent presentation, with possibly more
designs of the web site to choose from, more language versions, and
support for more output media.
</P>

<P>
The requirements:

<UL>
<LI>Application code with business logic mustn't be duplicated to
	achieve these multiple outputs.</LI>
<LI>Presentation should be completely separated from the actual code;
	application programmer should write SQL commands against the
	database and parse and merge results, but not create HTML
	markup.</LI>
</UL>

Even if Perl is very good for text processing and for HTML generation
alike, application program should never emit HTML. Why? Once its code
is tied to HTML, it's very hard (impossible?) to make it to also
output WML, PDF or SOAP responses. Code would have to be duplicated
and that is something that should be avoided.
</P>

<P>
Solution? Have application produce only data, in standard, compatible
form. Any output presentation can be created from the data.
Applications will get much simpler and presentation will be
centralized into one, easily maintainable point. XML seems like
a good choice these days; AxKit then adds instant framework that
only needs to be extended a bit to support that kind of dynamic
applications we need, and mod_perl provides the performance
we expect.
</P>

<H3>Interpolation into XML</H3>

<P>
We could generate the XML using

<PRE>
	print "&lt;name&gt;$name&lt;/name&gt;\n";
	print "&lt;age&gt;$computed_age&lt;/age&gt;\n";
</PRE>

calls but that still leaves the burden of watching for and escaping
characters that are special in XML on application programmer, not
mentioning the basic requirement of producing well formed XML with
matching tag names.
</P>

<P>
Since our scripts will be run in mod_perl environment and they will be
thus invoked as subroutines inside of <TT>Apache::Registry</TT> or
other dispatcher code, we can return <B>native Perl structures</B>
from them:

<PRE>
	return {
		'name' =&gt; $name,
		'age' =&gt; $computed_age,
		'cars' =&gt; $dbh-&gt;selectall_arrayref(q!
			select year_from, year_until, make
			from car_owners
			where owner = ?
			!, {}, $id),
		'owner_id' =&gt; $id,
	};
</PRE>
</P>

<P>
These data structures can be serialized into XML automatically, by
conversion of hashes and arrays into XML elements.
Alternatively, the data can be interpolated into structural
description of application's data which can be provided in
another, external XML source. In our example, the structural
description might be

<PRE>
  &lt;application&gt;
    &lt;search_cars&gt;
      &lt;inputbox name="owner_id"/&gt;
    &lt;/search_cars&gt;
    &lt;more_owners_found&gt;
      &lt;datalist name="more_owners"&gt;
        &lt;id/&gt;&lt;name/&gt;
      &lt;/datalist&gt;
    &lt;/more_owners_found&gt;
    &lt;owner_info&gt;
      &lt;data name="name"/&gt;&lt;data name="age"/&gt;
      &lt;datalist name="cars"&gt;
        &lt;year_from/&gt;&lt;year_to/&gt;&lt;car_make/&gt;
      &lt;/datalist&gt;
    &lt;/owner_info&gt;
  &lt;/application&gt;
</PRE>

and it both describes the logical structure of the application and its
input parameter (which may be used for parameter validation), and
provides placeholders for data returned from application.
</P>

<P>
After interpolation, the resulting XML is

<PRE>
  &lt;application&gt;
    &lt;search_cars&gt;
      &lt;inputbox name="owner_id"&gt72588&lt;/inputbox&gt;
    &lt;/search_cars&gt;
    &lt;more_owners_found&gt;
    &lt;/more_owners_found&gt;
    &lt;owner_info&gt;
      &lt;name&gt;John Smith&lt;/name&gt;
      &lt;age&gt;36&lt;/age&gt;
      &lt;cars&gt;
      &lt;row num="1"&gt;&lt;year_from&gt;1993&lt;/year_from&gt;
	&lt;year_to&gt;1998&lt;/year_to&gt;
	&lt;car_make&gt;Saab&lt;/car_make&gt;&lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;row num="2"&gt;&lt;year_from&gt;1997&lt;/year_from&gt;
	&lt;year_to&gt;&lt;/year_to&gt;
	&lt;car_make&gt;Volvo&lt;/car_make&gt;&lt;/row&gt;
      &lt;/cars&gt;
    &lt;/owner_info&gt;
  &lt;/application&gt;
</PRE>
</P>

<P>
Application thus consists of the description of its structure and the
actual code. While the first could be omitted, it provides good
communication tool among application analyst, application programmer
and presentation designers, and it can also serve for result
verification.
</P>

<H3>Presentation in AxKit</H3>

<P>
In AxKit, we can write our own handlers that will setup
presentation transformations based on user's requirements. Once the
data is available in XML, we can use standard chain of transformers to
provide desired design of pages, and also include output of some other
standard components on the output page ("news should be displayed on
top of all output pages, besides those intended for printing").
We can even provide localized stylesheets based on user's preferences
(sent by browser in HTTP headers, for example). We have also been
able to get PDF output, generated via stylesheet that creates TeX
source and running pdfTeX on it. For non-authenticated pages, AxKit's
builtin caching mechanism can speedup response and save CPU cycles.
</P>

<P>
The biggest problem with multiple format output seems to be design of
good structure of presentation stylesheets. With hundreds of
applications, hundreds of XML element names may appear in the system
and it is not practical to write new transformation for all of them
in each new design. Some sort of generalization is needed, which
would make it possible to keep the size and number of stylesheets
under control.
</P>

<P>
The bundle of modules that provide the interpolation of applications
output into XML and run necessary transformation on that data layer
is called <B>RayApp</B> and is available. For actual deployment,
modification to local specifics may be needed. That includes setup of
paths to stylesheets and handling of their localized versions; some
coding rather than just configuring will probably be involved.
</P>

<H3>Future of this approach</H3>

<P>
Only a small part of existing system was converted to use the XML data
layer. It provides great advantage in really separating presentation
from content -- application programmer doesn't care about HTML markup,
and applications do not even know if the actual request is for HTML
output or for WML. All the application has to do is to run desired
actions with data in database and produce output data structures.
</P>

<P>
With AxKit framework, all necessary pieces could be put together fast
-- Apache::Registry(NG) for application execution, LibXSLT for XSLT
transformation and Perl and its modules for the glue around it.
Management of presentation stylesheets seems to be the hardest part,
but it is not unique to this approach.
</P>

<P>
For environments where the number of individual applications is
relatively small, systems with embedded code may be superior. If the
number of application gets high, like with large systems, strictly
separating presentation from code is the way to go.
