<H3><I>Jan Pazdziora</I></H3>

<P>
Scheduled: 
Iterative Software room on Friday at 16:00-16:20 (paper # 35)
</P>

<P>
<B>Abstract:</B> AxKit is a package integrating flexible XML processing
management into Apache/mod_perl environment. It comes with wide range
of configuration options and programming hooks that allow fine tuning
of processes that will be run on input XML data. Originally written
and maintained by Matt Sergeant, it adopts quickly to changing world
of XML tools and adds supports for most of popular ones.
</P>

<P>
This presentation will introduce the AxKit architecture and steps that
are done during a data processing. Simple setups will be shown, but
focus will be put on explaining concepts of various stages and
hooks. Overview of available processors (XSLT, XPS) and trends will be
mentioned.
</P>

<HR />

<H3>XML is a good format</H3>

<P>
XML (Extensible Markup Language) is

<UL>
<LI>strictly defined;</LI>
<LI>and therefore compatible;</LI>
<LI>with good chance that it will be possible to process it by any
XML compliant software.</LI>
</UL>
</P>

<P>
It can be used to store structured information.
</P>

<P>
But people prefer other formats for their daily work, namely HTML
or PDF.
</P>

<P>
XML can be transformed into other formats, using many ways. Usually
the input XML, some transforming engine and a stylesheet are
involved.
</P>

<P>
Let's store data in XML and process it into other formats on demand.
</P>

<H3>AxKit for XML transformations and delivery</H3>

<P>Written by Matt Sergeant, it makes on-the-fly XML transformation
easy. Easier.</P>

<P>It supports a lot of transforming and generation engines,
LibXSLT and Sablotron for XSLT (Extensible Stylesheet Language
Transformations), XPathScript for transformations written in Perl
in more or less declarative way, or XSP for XML generation with
code embedded into XML source and with extensions in form of
taglibs, to name a few. 
</P>

<P>It also bundles other utility functions, like charset
transformation on output or gzipping the output.</P>

<P>Its main purpose is to provide framework in which order of
transformations and type of processing can be configured without
programming, using configuration options or processing instructions.
</P>

<H3>Let's start delivering XML data</H3>

<P>
AxKit works with Apache in mod_perl environment, so these better be
working first, and a couple of other modules will be required during
installation. Using <TT>perl -MCPAN -e shell</TT> will try to fetch
the prerequisites but some adjustment may be needed, especially if
external libraries are installed in
nonstandard places.
</P>

<P>
AxKit is the enabled and configured using

<PRE>
	PerlModule AxKit
</PRE>

in <TT>httpd.conf</TT> which loads the whole thing. For certain files,
directories or locations, AxKit is then enabled using

<PRE>
	SetHandler perl-script
	PerlHandler AxKit
</PRE>

and we'd better also say what transformation engine should be applied
for certain style:

<PRE>
	AxAddStyleMap text/xslt Apache::AxKit::Language::LibXSLT
</PRE>

</P>

<P>
If our source XML file contains processing instruction

<PRE>
	<?xml-stylesheet href="file.xslt" type="text/xslt"?>
</PRE>

AxKit will know that the LibXSLT library should be invoked to do the
transformation, using the stylesheet <TT>file.xslt</TT>.
</P>

<H3>Many configuration options</H3>

<P>
AxKit comes with large number of configuration options that can be
used to alter its transformation behavior. We can use
<TT>httpd.conf</TT> file to say what processors and what
transformations should be run, based on URI or media of the request
or DOCTYPE, DTD or other features of the source XML file.
</P>

<P>
Should available configuration options fail to provide enough
flexibility for our setup, we can always resort to extending AxKit
with our modules, that will be deployed by proper configuration.
</P>

<H3>Steps in request processing</H3>

<P>

<OL>
<LI>Request comes to Apache, it recognizes that it should be handled
	by AxKit.</LI>
<LI>AxKit is invoked and the request object passed to it.</LI>
<LI>Default environment is set for the request, including media and
	style.</LI>
<LI>Processing instructions from the source XML are fetched.</LI>
<LI>Processors are run in proper order.</LI>
<LI>Final actions (like character set conversions) are done on the
	output and that is sent back to client.</LI>
</OL>

AxKit handles caching of transformation results so if the requested
series of transformations was done before, stored results is passed
back to client. You can switch off the caching feature.
</P>

<P>
As more processors can be run on one source to achieve step-by-step
transformation, care must be taken when producing the output. If the
next processor expects to work on well formed XML, the previous one
has to provide it. On the other hand, with AxKit it is possible to
put into the chain transformations that do not work on XML at all and
are pure text processing done on text stream.
</P>

<H3>XSLT and XPathScript transformations</H3>

<P>
XSLT is a W3C standard for transformation of XML documents. 
Stylesheets contain templates for elements, attributes and other
parts of input XML, and output document mixed with other elements of
XSLT transformation that can process the input. External processors,
Sablotron or LibXSLT, are called to do the actual work..
</P>

<P>
XPathScript includes Perl code inside of output markup, and this code
can declaratively specify actions that should be done with
subdocuments of the input XML, based on element names.
</P>

<H3>XSP for XML generation</H3>

<P>
XSP is templating scheme that uses special XML element to include
dynamic content into static markup. Inside element
<TT>&lt;xsp:expr&gt;</TT>, any arbitrary Perl code can be included.
Special sets of elements, defined by taglibs, can be used to use
functionality from external modules, while avoiding
Perl code in XSP pages.
</P>

<H3>And it's written in Perl</H3>

<P>
AxKit is written in Perl and runs in mod_perl environment. Customized
modules can be added to extend its functionality both to support more
transformers or data producers, and to do specialized fine-tuning
tasks. Modules are run under mod_perl which gives them full access to
Apache's internals.
</P>

<P>
Already now the choice of tools bundled with AxKit is wide and Matt
is planning for more. From DocBook presentation of source XML documents
to cascades of transformations of dynamic content, the framework is
worth to be considered.
