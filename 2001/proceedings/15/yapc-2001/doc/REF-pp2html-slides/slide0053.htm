<H1>Security

<P>
Security is kept by running active contents in a safe environment via a <B>Safe</B> object if requested. This way every translator can implement its own grade of security, allowing only such operations which seem to be uncritical to the author.
</P>


<P>
Nevertheless, the necessary security grade may vary. Imagine a downloaded presentation source and a self written document. But even with own presentations it seems to be good advice to never translate a presentation with root permissions.
</P>


<P>
There are a few limitations in using <B>Safe</B>, especially if code wants to use modules. If security is not an issue, it's possible to bypass <B>Safe</B> completely. That's why embedded code can perform whatever operation Perl provides, but without any security restrictions. It's up to you to make your choice.
</P>


<P>
If active contents is disabled at all, all related PerlPoint elements (conditions, embedded and included code) are ignored.
</P>


<P>
Please refer to the specific translators documentation. Implementations can vary from generally disabled active contents to user configurable security settings.
