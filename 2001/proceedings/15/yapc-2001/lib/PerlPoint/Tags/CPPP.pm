=head1 NAME

B<PerlPoint::Tags::CPPP> - PerlPoint tag set used by pp2cppp

=head1 VERSION

This manual describes version B<0.01>.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # declare tags used by pp2cppp
  use PerlPoint::Tags::CPPP;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module declares PerlPoint tags used by C<pp2cppp>. Tag declarations
are used by the parser to determine if a used tag is valid, if it needs
options, if it needs a body and so on. Please see \B<PerlPoint::Tags>
for a detailed description of tag declaration.

Every PerlPoint translator willing to handle the tags of this module
can declare this by using the module in the scope where it built the
parser object.

  # declare basic tags
  use PerlPoint::Tags::CPPP;

  # load parser module
  use PerlPoint::Parser;

  ...

  # build parser
  my $parser=new PerlPoint::Parser(...);

  ...


=head1 TAGS

B<PerlPoint::Tags::CPPP> declares all the tags of B<PerlPoint::Tags::Basic>.

Additionally, the B<PerlPoint::Tags::HTML> tags C<L> and C<U> are supported.
C<pp2cppp> might interprete them slightly different to C<pp2html>, please
read its documentation for details.
