This directory contains documentation about PerlPoint
and a selfcontained installation of all PerlPoint modules
in the ./lib directory.

To use the pp2html script set the YAPC_PP envionment variable
to the directory (absolute pathname) which contains this
README file:

On a Linux or UNIX system with csh/tcsh:

  setenv YAPC_PP `pwd`

or in a bash or sh:

  YAPC_PP=`pwd`

All the needed modules should be installed in ./lib and should be
found after setting this variable: The pp2html program has been
patched with "use lib" statements, using $ENV{YAPC_PP}.

(I hope I have included all what is not in the standard perl5.6.0
installation path. This is not tested yet, so it may be that you
have to install some additional modules ...)

The ./doc directory contains HTML versions of six documents:

* Getting-started-slides/frame_set.html

* FAQ-pp2html-slides/frame_set.html

* FAQ-parser-slides/frame_set.html

* REF-pp2html-slides/frame_set.html

* wrco/frame_set.html

* PP_article/frame_set.html

All documents can be created via Makefile from PerlPoint
input files (.pp files).
