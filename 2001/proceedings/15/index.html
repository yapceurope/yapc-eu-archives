The <a href="yapc-2001">documentation</a>
contains an article, an introduction, a reference,
FAQ's and more, all in source and in HTML format. A README file is
provided to introduce this package. The bundle includes a preinstalled
version of PerlPoint which should run out of the box (on UNIX systems)
to enable CD users to play with the software without further
installations.
<p>
A snapshot of 
<a href="PerlPoint-Converters-0.1001.tar.gz">PerlPoint::Converters</a> which
is not available on CPAN but is the base of the software provided with the
doc package</a>.
<p>
The current version of
<a href="PerlPoint-Package-0.34.tgz">PerlPoint::Package</a>, which is the
same version as found on CPAN.
