<strong>Abstract</strong><p>
Security is not about having just a correctly configured firewall in
place anymore. More and more security vulnerabilities arise due to badly
written applications which can often be forced into doing things they
were not supposed to do.
<p>
Many of those applications are written in Perl; especially for web sites
Perl is very popular. However, the power of the Perl language also makes
those applications a nice target for people with bad intentions. And the
majority of web programmers program for 'cool' functionality only.
<p>
This talk will discuss examples of past security problems in Perl
scripts, discuss hints and tips to avoid security problems and will show
how Perl can help you avoiding security problems, however, only to a
certain extend.
