First we create one vumeter bar.
A widget is represented by an object (package) with the same name.  Most
parts of the widget's creation are done by Tk: with a few lines, you have
a new widget.
<P>
First, you have to tell Tk where this widget can be a child of.  The
<CODE>Tk::Widget</CODE> is the base-class of Tk, which means that my
<CODE>vu</CODE> widget can be contained in any other object.
<P>
The construct call is just the same as:
<PRE>
   Tk::Widget->Construct('vu');
</PRE>
but it looks a bit more as a special language facility in this list-notation;
just a bit more status to Tk ;)
<P>
Specialised (derived) widgets shall always also inherit methods of
<CODE>Tk::Derived</CODE>, which will overrule methods of the super-class
widget.
The <CODE>Tk::Derived</CODE> must be the first in the <CODE>@ISA</CODE>. I do
not know where this design flaw happened, but we have to live with it.
<P>
At creation of the widget, the <CODE>InitObject</CODE> of the super-class
will call your method <CODE>Populate</CODE> to add more configuration flags
to the widget, or to overrule configuration flag defaults.  This is done
via the <CODE>ConfigSpecs</CODE>, which I will explain later.
<P>
The <CODE>$args</CODE> is a reference to the hash containing the flags which
were given by the user.  You may delete from it.  <CODE>Populate</CODE> shall
call its super-class to collect the other configuration flags.<BR>
When all flags are known, the <CODE>InitObject</CODE> of the super-class will
process the flags and defaults.
