(<A HREF=../examples/tk-callback>source</A>)
<EM>Entry</EM> uses a <EM>tie</EM> to capture the value of the variable.  A
change to the variable from the program will cause the tied Entry-widget to
update the value on the screen.</P>

<P>The <CODE>-command</CODE> defines a <EM>callback</EM>.  Callbacks are
used to respond to user-actions, in this case the user who is pushing
the button.  Callbacks are hard to program exactly right; you have to
understand Perl very well to distinguish between different formulations:
<P>
<BR CLEAR=right>
<DL>
<DT><CODE>-command => $c->move($l, $x, $y)</CODE>
<DD>The <EM>move</EM> command is called on the moment that the options for the
    button is collected: when the button is generated.  The line will
    appear on the screen in its moved position (remember that the window
    will not be drawn before MainLoop is reached).<BR>
    Pushing the button will result in an error, because the result of
    move will not be a valid callback (you hope).
    <P>
<DT><CODE>-command => [ 'move', $l, $x, $y ]</CODE>
<DD>The definition of callbacks says that this will be translated
    into: <CODE>$button->move($l, $x, $y)</CODE> when the button is pushed.
    This not correct, because you need to call move on canvas.  In most
    case where you write a callback, this notation is useful, but not in
    this case.
    <P>
    Next to that, keep in mind that the values of <CODE>$l</CODE>,
    <CODE>$x</CODE>, and <CODE>$y</CODE> are
    substituted on the moment of definition: the line will always
    move over <CODE>(15, 10)</CODE>.
    <P>
<DT><CODE>-command => [ 'move', $c, $l, $x, $y ]</CODE>
<DD>This doesn't help much: the move will still be called on a button, but
    it is not a defined operation for a button.
    <P>
<DT><CODE>-command => [ $c, 'move', $l, $x, $y ]</CODE>
<DD>If this callback was used in a <CODE>bind</CODE>, which will be
    discussed later, than this would be a valid choice: bind looks
    if the first argument of the list is an object.  If so, it calls
    the method on that object.  Mind however, that we are still moving
    over a constant <CODE>(15,10)</CODE>.
    <P>
<DT><CODE>-command => [ sub {$c->move($l, @_)}, $x, $y ]</CODE>
<DD>In this case, the move will always be over <CODE>(15, 10)</CODE>, but
    <CODE>$l</CODE> will be used with the value on moment of the call.
    <P>
    Perl keeps the value of a variable alive as long as it can be
    accessed, even when the variable is a <CODE>my</CODE> and you leave
    the enclosing code-block (for instance the subroutine).
    Each <CODE>my $l</CODE> will result in a distinct variable.
    <P>
<DT><CODE>-command => sub {$c->move($l, $x, $y)}</CODE>
<DD>The last example finally achieves our goal: call the subroutine
    when the button is pushed.  The move uses the actual values stored
    in <CODE>$l</CODE>, <CODE>$x</CODE>, and <CODE>$y</CODE>
    <P>
<DT><CODE>-command => [ sub {$_[0]->move($_[1], $x, $y)}, $c, $l ]</CODE>
<DD>An even better notation.  In this case, I can reuse <CODE>$c</CODE>
    and <CODE>$l</CODE> for creating more objects.  Both are shown
    to be constants.  Of course, this is equivalent with:
<PRE>
   -command => [ sub { my ($c, $l) = @_;
                       $c->move($l, $x, $y)}
               , $c, $l ]
</PRE>
</DL>
