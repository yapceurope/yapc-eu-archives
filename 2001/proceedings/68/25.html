<h1 align = "center">leftop and rightop</h1>

<p>
In the production rules of the calculator, the grammar rules for
<tt>statement</tt>, <tt>expression</tt> and <tt>term</tt> are kind
of awkward and inefficient. They are recursive, which could lead to
backtracking, and it's not always easy to get the rules right.
<p>
Therefore, <tt>Parse::RecDescent</tt> has 2 directives, <tt>leftop</tt>
and <tt>rightop</tt>, which can be used to to describe the behaviour
of left associative and right associative operators.
<p>
The syntax is:
<pre>
        &lt;leftop: left operator right>
        &lt;rightop: left operator right>
</pre>
where <tt>left</tt>, <tt>operator</tt> and <tt>right</tt> are items
as described earlier.
<p>
The return value of such a directive is a reference to an array, 
whose elements are the values of the items <tt>left</tt> and
<tt>right</tt>. That is, the value of <tt>operator</tt> is discarded,
<strong>except</strong> when <tt>operator</tt> is a rule, or when
<tt>operand</tt> is a regular expression, and the first bracketed
expression returns a value (that is, <tt>$1</tt> is defined).
