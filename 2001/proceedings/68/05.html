<h1 align = "center">Context Sensitive Grammars & Unrestricted Grammars</h1>

<ul>
<li>Unrestricted Grammars are the largest family of grammars in the
    Chomsky hierarchy. The languages described by them are the 
    recursively enumerable languages (r.e. languages).
<li>Unrestricted grammars have production rules of the form:
    <tt>a -> b</tt>, which <tt>a</tt> and <tt>b</tt> arbitrary
    strings of grammar symbols.
<li>Context Sensitive Grammars are a subset, with the additional rule
    that of production rules <tt>a -> b</tt>, the length of <tt>b</tt> has
    to be at least the length of <tt>a</tt>. Context Sensitive Grammars
    describe Context Sensitive Languages.
<li>Almost all concievable languages are Context Sensitive Languages.
<li>Recursively enumerable languages require a Turing Machine to parse, while
    Context Sensitive Languages can be parsed with a Linear Bounded
    Automaton; a Turing Machine with a finite amount of tape.
