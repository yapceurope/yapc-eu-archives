<ul>
<li>Grammar consists of a set of rules.
<li>Each rule starts with an identifier (which corresponds to a 
    <em>non-terminal</em>), followed by a colon, followed by zero
    or more <strong>productions</strong>, separated by vertical
    bars.
<li>If there is more than one production for a rule, they are alternatives,
    and a similar effect can be reached by having several rules starting
    with the same identifier.
<li>Each production consists of zero or more <strong>items</strong>.
<li>Items are: 
    <ul><li><strong>Subrule</strong>:   another rule to be matched.
        <li><strong>Token</strong>:     a literal or a regex to be matched.
             This has to match at the beginning of the unparsed part
             of the to be parsed string - skipping over any leading whitespace.
             This corresponds to the so-called <em>terminals</em>.
        <li><strong>Action</strong>:    a piece of Perl code to be executed.
        <li><strong>Directive</strong>: a special instruction to the parser.
        <li><strong>Comment</strong>:   a standard Perl comment.
    </ul>
</ul>
