<title>Parsing: Dynamic rules</title>
</head>

<body>
<h1 align = "center">Dynamic rules</h1>

<ul>
<li>Tokens that use double quoted strings or regexes do interpolation.
<li>Hence, they can be make context sensitive, by referring to other
    items in the production rule. For instance, by interpolating 
    <tt>$item</tt>.
<li>The <tt>&lt;matchrule:...></tt> is another way of building dynamic
    rules. The part after the colon is evaluated as a double quoted
    string <strong>each</strong> time the directive is encountered,
    and the value it evaluates to is taken as the name of the subrule to
    be matched.
</ul>
