      ERROR (line 10): Untranslatable item encountered: "!"
                (Hint: Did you misspell "!" or forget to comment it out?)

      ERROR (line 13): Untranslatable item encountered: "&lt;leftpo:"
                (Hint: Did you misspell "&lt;leftpo:" or forget to comment it
                       out?)

      ERROR (line 13): Unmatched > found.
                (Hint: A '>' angle bracket was encountered, which typically
                       indicates the end of a directive. However no suitable
                       preceding directive was encountered. Typically this
                       indicates either a extra '>' in the grammar, or a
                       problem inside the previous directive.)

                ERROR: Rule "factor" is left-recursive.
                (Hint: Redesign the grammar so it's not left-recursive. That
                       will probably mean you need to re-implement repetitions
                       using the '(s)' notation. For example: "factor(s)".)

              Warning: Undefined (sub)rule "variabel" used in a production.
                (Hint: Will you be providing this rule later, or did you
                       perhaps misspell "variabel"? Otherwise it will be
                       treated as an immediate &lt;reject>.)
