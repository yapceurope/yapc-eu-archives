<h1>A fractal camel in PostScript... almost!</h1>
<p>This talk presents and deconstructs three heavily
obfuscated programs in a colorful way.</p>

<h2><a href="fractal_00.html">Julia Mandelbrot</a></h2>
<p>This code is a schizophrenic
<a href="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/jargon/html/entry/boustrophedon.html">boustrophedon</a>.
It was one of my 7 entries for the 5<sup>th</sup> Obfuscated Perl Contest
held by <a href="http://www.tpj.com/">TPJ</a> in August 2000.
It was disqualified for being too long (more than 512 characters).</p>

<h2><a href="camel_00.html">Camel code</a></h2>
<p>In December 2000, <a href="http://www.nrc.ca/~jenkins/">Stephen B.
Jenkins</a> (aka
<a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node=Erudil">Erudil</a>)
posted on Perlmonks a piece of camel-shaped obfuscated code that prints
a reduced version of itself.
<a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/">ThinkGeek</a> has since published
a <a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/stuff/things/321a.html">T-shirt</a>
with this code on the back.
</p>

<h2><a href="bestever.html">The Best Ever</a></h2>
<p>
This is another of my several entries for OPC5. This is a
bilingual program in Perl and PostScript. This one was also disqualified
for being too long. Said The Perl Journal's Felix Gallo:
</p>
<blockquote><cite>Although Mssr. Bruhat's
combination PostScript/Perl (yes, really) entry was The Best Ever, it was
also many, many more bytes than permitted.</cite></blockquote>
