<P><CODE>Mail::Folder</CODE> hasn't been maintained for many years.  It can
happen, but we cannot be happy about it.  Next to that, there are so many
different types of folders, and they develop over type.  The software needs
to adapt to new possibilities.</P>

<P>Correctness is a more serious complaint.  Many e-mail applications are
doing a bad job in following the specification: they produce corrupt
headers, wrong part-separators, and such.  Especially doing mbox folders
right is a hard problem; mainly caused by the fact that also the body
of a message might contain a line with <CODE>/^From /</CODE>, which is
easy to be confused with the message separator.</P>

<P>Writing more fault-tolerant mail-folder scanning algorithms in Perl
would be too slow: the current, simple, algorithm is just acceptable in
speed.  We could use the help of C, but more about that at the
end of this talk.</P>

<P>MH- and IMAP-like folders are slow by definition, as each message
is in a separate file.  Reading a folder with 1000 messages means 1000
times an <CODE>open</CODE> of a file, a disk-seek to the data.  Can
you fight this?</P>
