    <div class="main">
      Here are a few questions which I've been asked about this talk after I
      delivered a preliminary version to London.pm.
      If your question isn't here then either collar me at the conference
      or send me email.
      
      <dl>
        <dt>What does <i>mutagenic</i> mean?</dt>
        <dd>My dictionary (the Shorter Oxford) says <i>Causing or capable
            of causing mutation.</i>  It's appropriate enough to make some
            kind of sense, as well as sounding suitably scary :-)</dd>
        
        <dt>How far have you got with the <code>B::Parse</code> module
            mentioned at the end of the talk?
        <dd>I haven't started working on it yet. There are several things
            that need to be done first: most importantly there is a crippling
            limitation of compiler backends in general, and B::Deparse in
            particular, which needs to overcome before it could be made to
            work properly.
        
        <dt>How does all this relate to Perl 6?</dt>
        <dd>It's impossible to give a definitive answer until we can
            see the final shape that Perl 6 is going to take. However we can be fairly
            sure that Perl 6 will be even more flexible than Perl 5, particularly
            in the way that it's parsed. It should create some exciting new
            possibilities in this area.
        
        <dt>How does it relate to Damian Conway's work on filtering and parsing?
        <dd>A lot of Dr Conway's work involves taking extraordinary and unlikely-seeming
            structures, and transforming them into Perl code. His Lingua::Romana::Perligata
            is a fine example. The projected Parse::Perl module will provide a general
            mechanism for doing this sort of thing.
            
            <p>On one interpretation, that's the <i>opposite</i> of what I'm trying to
            do. I want to be able to take perfectly ordinary Perl code and make it
            <i>behave</i> in new and strange ways. Of course there's no reason
            that you couldn't combine the two, if you were feeling especially evil.</p>
        
        <dt>How does it relate to Simon Cozens's <code>B::Generate</code> module?
        <dd>That's similar to the previous question. B::Generate enables one to write
        (among other things) compilers which will turn other languages into Perl bytecode.
        
        <dt>Have you thought of such-and-such an idea?</dt>
        <dd>Probably not, but I'd like to hear about it. Send me an email; or accost
        me at the conference if you're still here, or at a London.pm meeting if you
        live in London.
