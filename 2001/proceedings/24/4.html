<h2>why I chose Perl for the job</h2>
<p>
<ul>
<li><b> What else is there ;-)?</b><br />
	Not really a joke...I know no other language well enough to start writing an application in it. Besides I was quite confident Perl could do anything I needed for it.</li>
<li><b> Write once, run anywhere...</b><br />
	Hadn't I heard that before? Anyway: I run Linux myself, but I know most people still use Win32 platforms. I want to give that application away to anyone who needs it, and these people will only use it if it runs on their platform. So it should at least run on Linux and Win32. VB is not an option. I know nothing of Java...Perl does the job!</li>
