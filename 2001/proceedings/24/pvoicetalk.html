<h2>What was the case?</h2>
<p><ul>
<li><b> <a href="krista_uses_pvoice.avi">Video of Krista</a></b><br />
	To get an idea of Krista's possibilities I'll show a small piece of video of her riding in her wheelchair and using pVoice and pStory.</li>
<li><b> She can't talk, and probably never will except for small sounds ('aah', 'ey', 'oo')</b><br />
	That's enough to clarify things she can't tell exact through a computer, but not for everything.</li>
<li><b> Has hardly any control of hands and feet, but a little of her head.</b><br />
	As is shown in the video, Krista's feet are tied to the wheelchair, because otherwise they would kick around in the air. On the video the therapist asks her to untie her waist by using  her hands, but she indicates she can't do that...</li>
<li><b> Learns to drive her powered wheelchair by moving her head</b><br />
	In due time she will start and stop the wheelchair too, but for now she's concentrating on steering with her head. As you could see she perfectly drove through a narrow door, which means she can really do this if she's concentrated enough.</li>
<li><b> She has a lot to tell! She's a normal 6-year old!</b><br />
	Maybe her looks are hiding it, but she's a normal kid! She wants to do everything a normal kid does, play, tell, laugh, cry, feel. But she can't do all that. </li>
<li><b> Frustration every day that she can't tell what she wants, what she's done at school, etc.</b><br />
	You can imagine that if you go to school every day, you have a lot to tell when you come home. Or if you visit your grandparents, you'd like to tell them about what you've done since you last saw them...Krista can't. And that's frustrating. </li>
</ul>
