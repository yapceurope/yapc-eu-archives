<title>pVoice - using Perl to enable the disabled</title>

<h2>the requirements for such an application</h2>
<p>
<ul>
<li><b> Handicapped people have specifically adapted inputdevices</b><br />
	Like the headsupport Krista uses along with the "Icon II", which is basically an input converter between a swich of any kind and a serial mouse. It will however be a big challenge to support more of these devices. Her wheelchair already has another possibility, which I have try: an output which also uses the footswitches...</li>
<li><b> It has to be intuitive (the main user is only six years old!)</b><br />
	Six year old children can't read. They don't understand pop-up menus, abbreviations, or whatever. Most normal kids can easily play computergames. But a voice-application should have a "quiet" interface with as little distracting items on screen as possible. No flashing buttons saying "Click me!", etc.</li>
<li><b> It can't crash! If it crashes during operation the user loses his or her voice!</b><br />
	It sounds obvious, but we all know the quality of Windows applications in general. However, pVoice (compiled with IndigoSTAR's Perl2Exe) runs very reliable on Windows 98. Just don't run that OS 24/7...</li>
</ul>
