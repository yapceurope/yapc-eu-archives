<h2>Why did I build this myself and did not use available software?</h2>
<p>
<ul>
<li><b> They all require real computeroperation (mouse, keyboard)</b><br />
	Most disabled people have a way to click on a button, type a key, and almost all available software requires these basic ways of operating a computer. For people like Krista, that is already too much.</li>
<li><b> I wanted do something 'good' with my skills</b></li>
<li><b> It's fun!</b><br />
	It's certainly the most rewarding software project you can think of!</li>
</ul>
