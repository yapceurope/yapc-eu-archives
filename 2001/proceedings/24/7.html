<h2>what lies ahead</h2>
<p>
<ul>
<li><b> Integrating speech synthesizers</b><br />
	Actually, I wanted to go with Festival. But again, the win32 support seems it's week spot. So what I decided is that it should be able to run with a variety of speech synthesizers in the future. I'll probably start with Festival and the Microsoft Speech Tools.</li>
<li><b> Creating a simple interface to add/delete/modify the symbols and sounds.</b><br />
	Right now the editing of words and categories is being done by editing a bunch of textfiles. Which is not really userfriendly...</li>
<li><b> Constantly adjust it to the wishes of the users</b><br />
	I already have a small list of wishes and will continue to improve it</li>
<li><b> Creating a new symbol-language</b><br />
	Briac Pilpre and Stefano Rodighiero are helping me to develop a new symbollanguage, since all existing languages are copyrighted. We want to create a free language, since we believe in free speech (free as in beer that is!)</li>
<li><b> More 'p' series</b><br />
	pStory is already available, pJukebox is the first on the list (an MP3 player) and after that I will be working on pHomeControl, which will be an environment-control system through X10 and 802.11b (wireless lan).</li>
<li><b> More people</b><br />
	One time I setup a sourceforge project for pVoice, but never really used it. But since more projects are coming, I think it would be better if more people started working on it</li>
