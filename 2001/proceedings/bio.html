a regular participant in <a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/">Perlmonks</a>,
under the username
<a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node=BooK">BooK</a>.
Using Perl actively since 1998, he is known for his obfuscations which
<i>never</i> won the Obfuscated Perl Contest... <tt>;-)</tt>
<p>
During the summer of 2001, he worked on the translation of chapters 3 to 9 of
<a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=31583">Amelia</a>
(the pet name of the
<a href="http://www.ora.com/catalog/pperl3/">Camel book, 3<sup>rd</sup>

<a href="http://www.cmg.fr/">CMG France</a>.
<p>
<a name="cross"><strong>Dave Cross</strong></a><br>
Dave Cross is an active member of the Perl community and is a regular
poster to Perl discussion boards. In 1998, Dave founded the London
Perl Mongers group, the first Perl users' group outside the USA. He is
still the nominal leader of this group.
<p>
More recently, Dave has become a Perl writer and trainer. He has
written articles for The Perl Journal and www.perl.com and was a
regular columnist for PerlMonth. In January 2001, his first book Data
Munging with Perl was published by Manning. He is a regular speaker
at Perl conferences.
<p>
<a name="grunauer"><strong>Marcel Grunauer</strong></a><br>
	Marcel Grunauer has studied computer science at the Technical
	University of Vienna and has developed software since the early
	90s. He has been involved with the Perl community for several
	years, has attended Perl conferences, and has recently been
	active in London.pm and Vienna.pm.
<p>
	He has taught a few introductory Perl classes on a small

	MARCEL) and proofread Dave Cross' book "Data Munging with Perl".
<p>
<a name="ingerson"><strong>Brian Ingerson</strong></a><br>
Brian Ingerson lives in Vancouver BC, and is working to make the 
Perl a better place. 
<p>
<a name="karrenberg"><strong>Daniel Karrenberg</strong></a><br>
Daniel Karrenberg has helped to build the European Internet
since the early 80s. As one of the founding members of the
German Unix Users Group he has been involved in the setting
up of EUnet, a pan-European coperative network providing 
electronic mail and news to businesses and academic institutions 
all over Europe. While at CWI in Amsterdam, Karrenberg has 
helped to expand this network and convert it to a fully IP 
based service. During this time he created a 'whois' database 
of operational contacts, that was the nucleus of the current
RIPE database. Karrenberg is one of the founders of RIPE, 
the IP coordination body for Europe and surrounding areas. 
In 1992 he was asked to set up the RIPE NCC, the first 
regional internet registry providing IP numbers to thousands 
of Internet service providers in more than 90 countries.
Karrrenberg has lead the RIPE NCC until 1999 when it had 
an international staff of 70 with more than 25 nationalities;
he currently helps to develop new RIPE NCC services.
Recently his contributions have been recognised by the Internet Society 
with its '<a
href="http://www.isoc.org/isoc/media/releases/010607pr.shtml">Jon 
Postel Service Award</a>'. 
Karrenberg's current interests 
include measurements of Internet performance and routing 
as well as security within the Internet infrastructure.
In general he likes building new and interesting things.
<p>
Daniel has been an avid user of Perl since he converted from 
'csh+sed+grep+awk'. Most of his programming projects start 
as a perl prototype and most of them end there because the
prototype is 'good enough for now'. Daniel has received numerous
and humorous threats from those who have had to re-implement 
some of these prototypes after they turned out to provide 
real services.
<p>
<a name="maher"><strong>Tim Maher</strong></a><br>
During the last two decades, Dr. Tim Maher has taught programming
to thousands of high-tech professionals.  As a Professor of
Computer Science, and later as a Software Instructor for AT&amp;T,
Sun, DEC, Hewlett Packard, and CONSULTIX, Dr. Maher has consistently
earned acclaim for his highly effective and entertaining style of
course development and presentation.

Associates, Inc.</a>  He has written several books on computer
topics, and, as an editor, has had a major hand in the development

<a name="schwern"><strong>Michael G Schwern</strong></a><br>
	Schwern's code runs like a rash across CPAN, with 28 modules
        as of this writing including Class::DBI, Carp::Assert, 
        Semi::Semicolons and Sex totaling some 10,000 lines of code,
        13,000 of documentation and 3,500 of tests.  Because he 
        couldn't keep his big mouth shut, he finds himself
        Perl6 Quality Assurance manager.  Having spoken at TPC 4 and
        every YAPC yet, its a wonder they keep letting him back.
        When not coding up Yet Another CPAN module, Schwern enjoys
        stuffing various sea creatures into his overalls and shooting
        bad technical books.
