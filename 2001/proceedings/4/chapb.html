<h3><a name="saga">The saga continues: the plane patch</a></h3>
<p>Now that the bug is fixed, and the patch is accepted (as patch 6340), I
wanted to extend the knowledge I picked up along the way. Realizing that
at the moment it is not possible to detect <b><i>if</i></b> a format is
defined at all, because globs cannot deal with it's FORMAT entry. Making
glob's do what they should do for formats too, i.e. make *TOP{FORMAT} be
as valid as *TOP{SCALAR}, *TOP{HASH} and all known other glob entries.</p>
</p>
<p>I was talking about this with Jan-Pieter Cornet on our way to TPC4, and
we decided to give it a shot, and hacked towards it in the plane. We did
the right patch, but made a wrong test for it, so we didn't trust
ourselves in submitting it. Graham Barr helped us with the test</p>

<p>This patch also made it through to the core, but was rejected by Gurusamy
Sarathy for the 5.6.0 and 5.6.1 track. His motivations were not convincing
for me, and some discussions with Gurusamy and Jarkko led to acceptation in
the 5.7 development track (where it has always been) and eventually the patch
is accepted also for the 5.8.0 release of Perl.</p>
