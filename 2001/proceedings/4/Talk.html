<ul>
 <li>Data
  <p>We do have a process that extracts all data from a database related to
  one single person repeatedly and spits it out in an intermediate format
  easy to parse by secondary processes like formatters.</p>
  <p>This format looks like:</p>
  <pre>
    cc|eeee|data</pre>
  <p>where <code><b>cc</b></code> stands for the category
  <code><b>data</b></code> belongs to identified by element type (number)
  <code><b>eeee</b></code>. Element codes can occur in multiple categories
  (like a surname or a date of birth) and can occur more than once in a
  single category (like free notes). It might look

<p>Hmm, I hope you'll see the maintainability factor of such code is
extremely low :-(</p>
<p>But since this code is the same for all reports, it's stored in a seperate
file, which is prepended to the format part on a "need-now" basis, which
enables easy to maintain the different format scripts as such.</p>

<h3><a name="problem">And what's the problem</a></h3>
<p>It does what we want without flaws, so what's the problem?</p>
<p>Maintainability! It's gotten out of hand. And we want <i>more</i>!
More features, more speed, and - maybe most important - more
maintainability.</p>

<h3><a name="else">What else and why</a></h3>
<p>By that time, perl5 just hit the street, and I played with perl4 for
some time, also building a perl interface to our (so far unsupported)
database into perl4.</p>
<p>Reading the advantages of perl5 over perl4, the symbolic references hit
me as extremely useful, because conversion would be easy as pie. The format
part would become something <a href="symref/lp_002_pl">like</a>:</p>

<p>which makes it already quite a lot easier to see what the user expects as
output, and all the variables are the same, except for that funny leading
dollarsign in front.<br />
The initialization part would become <i>real easy</i> <a href="symref/lpepl">
(shortened):</a></p>
<pre>
    while (<>) {
        chomp;
        push @elp, $_;
        m/^99/ || next;

        # Convert the expanded LP-list to elements known in the format(s)
        foreach $lp (@elp) {
            ($cat, $type, $data) = split m/\|/, $lp, 3;
            $data =~ s/\s+$//;
            $ect  = "$cat$type";
            $e    = "e$ect";
            $$e   = $data;
            }

        # format this entity
        write;

        reset "e";
        }</pre>
<p>In fact, the first version of the perl equivalent of the 1350 line RPT
script, were reduced to a mere 150 line of code!<p>

<h3><a name="strict"><code>use strict;</code></a></h3>

<p>As the symbolic reference solution looked like a good solution when I
started, given the time saved by not having to go through all those report
scripts doing more then just prefix all variables with a dollar sign (and
keep the variables readable), I learned over time that <code><b>use
strict;</b></code> was not a bad idea.</p>

<p>So I started to use lexicals, and convert the data structure from
<code>$e010110</code> to <code>$e[1]{110}</code>, something some of you,
if not most of you, would have thought of when faced with the problem in
the beginning.</p>

<p>From the programmers eye, this is no problem, but more simple users
have less problems recognizing $e010240 as being the surname of the person
is much easier than recognizing $e[1]{240}, but - since most of my user
base didn't change to formats anyway, I decided that to be a <i>minor</i>
problem.</p>

<p>Now the initialization becomes something like:</p>
<pre>
    while (<>) {
        s/\s*$//;
        push @elp, $_;
        m/^99/ or next;

        # Convert the expanded LP-list to elements known in the format(s)
        foreach my $lp (@elp) {
            my ($cat, $type, $data) = split m/\|/, $lp, 3;
            $e[$cat]{$type} = $data;
            }

        # format this entity
        write;

        @e = ();
        }</pre>
<p>... much cleaner and loosing the <code>reset</code>, also less error-prone.
The format script would become something <a href="strict/lp_002_pl">like:</a>

<h3><a name="resc">Resources and Self-motivation</a></h3>

<p>After digging through the available resources:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Documentation</li>
  <li>Mailing list (archives)</li>
  <li>Change logs</li>
  <li>Source code</li>
  </ul>
<p>I still found no suitable place to start, because there's not much
reference material on formats</p>
<p>There's a lot of discussions on perl5-porters varying from thread
implementations to unicode handling and from string interpolation to
regular expression irregularities, but <b>format</b>'s are not discussed,
so the mailing list archives are not a good resource. So I had to do some
research myself.</p>
<p>Several mails to the mailing list asking for a place to start the
research led to 2 pointers, both proved to be very wrong, because they
assumed the flaw was in the formatting code.</p>
<p>Digging. Learning how to use gdb, which - on a HP-UX platform - proved
to be less than easy. And though perlguts turned out to be a nice manual
for the parts that did not blow up in my face, I had to track down what
was happining, and try to follow the flow that is used when parsing
formats.</p>
<p>After turning the formatting inside out and upside dow, not finding
anything unusual happening, I just added <code>printf</code> statements
haphazardly throughout the perl source code on points where I did expect
the flow to pass by, and printed out some global variables. At this point
intuition turns out to be more valuable than knowledge, cause I almost hit
the right globals from the start.</p>
<p>Realizing a not very well known fact that the variable declaration
within a form definition can span multiple lines if the starting line of
those variable <i>start with</i> a open brace, I was intuitively looking
for places that dealt with that code.</p>
<p>It turned out to be the closing brace <code>}</code> that caused a
reset of a global brace counter when not aware of being inside a format
parsing. I then did a decrement, instead of a reset, to check if I was
right, and the format part now compiled, but other code parts did not.</p>
<p>So the solution was at hand: the trouble spot was detected, but I had
to find a way to <i>detect</i> (or rather <i>know</i>) that at that point
I was inside a format and, if so, decrement, otherwise reset.</p>

<h3><a name="found">Found it! What next?</a></h3>
<p>OK, the problem is in toke.c on line 3175 where the detected closeing
brace '}' also ends the current scope instead of just decrementing the
in-brace count, ...
</p>
<p>The patch to correct this looked <a href="6340.patch">like</a>:</p>

<h3><a name="saga">The saga continues: the plane patch</a></h3>
<p>Now that the bug is fixed, and the patch is accepted (as patch 6340), I
wanted to extend the knowledge I picked up along the way. Realizing that
at the moment it is not possible to detect <b><i>if</i></b> a format is
defined at all, because globs cannot deal with it's FORMAT entry. Making
glob's do what they should do for formats too, i.e. make *TOP{FORMAT} be
as valid as *TOP{SCALAR}, *TOP{HASH} and all known other glob entries.</p>
</p>
<p>I was talking about this with Jan-Pieter Cornet on our way to TPC4, and
we decided to give it a shot, and hacked towards it in the plane. We did
the right patch, but made a wrong test for it, so we didn't trust
ourselves in submitting it. Graham Barr helped us with the test</p>

<p>This patch also made it through to the core, but was rejected by Gurusamy
Sarathy for the 5.6.0 and 5.6.1 track. His motivations were not convincing
for me, and some discussions with Gurusamy and Jarkko led to acceptation in
the 5.7 development track (where it has always been) and eventually the patch
is accepted also for the 5.8.0 release of Perl.</p>

<h3><a name="next">The next temptation</a></h3>

<p>By extending the test suite for the <code>write</code> functionality, in
order to get the patches also accepted for 5.8.0, I hit a new
<a href="format2_pl">problem</a> in a situation where I tried to <i>nest</i>
(yes I know that's sick) formats:</p>
<pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl -w

use strict;

format HEADER =
HEADER
.
sub HEADER ()
{
    local $~ = "HEADER";
    my $HEADER;
    open HEADER, ">", \$HEADER;
    select HEADER;
    write;
    close HEADER;
    select STDOUT;
    $HEADER;
    } # HEADER
format STDOUT_TOP =
TOP
@<<<<<
@{[HEADER]}
.
format STDOUT =
STDOUT
@<<<<
$%
.
write;</pre>
<p>which should produce:</p>
<pre>
TOP
HEADER
STDOUT
1</pre>
<p>but instead produces:</p>
<pre>
page overflow at format2_pl line 19.
STDOUT
0
TOP
HEADER</pre>
<p>I did not have enough time to find out what exactly is going on, but I
<i>did</i> find out that it needs some serious hacking</p>

<h3><a name="p5p">Perl5-porters</a></h3>
<p>Now that I got the hack of it, I seriously considered to put some more
effort in the perl5-porters movement. I was not scared away by rumours of
the list being very unfriendly and flame wars being more common than found
on other lists.</p>
<p>First thing to do is be a good listener. Don't join every discussion
you see flying by, and only respond if you know what you're talking about.
If you are sure, don't be afraid to be scared away, but always use funded
arguments to explain what you mean. Don't be surprised if it turns out that
the old members realy listen to you and see you as a serious participant in
the development of Perl.</p>
<p>I wanted to join perl5-porters to take over Ilya's position. Hmmmm. So
much for aiming too high.</p>
<p>There are several reasons why this did not happen.</p>
<ul>
  <li>I wasn't good enough</li>
  <li>I didn't have enough time for it</li>
  <li>Hugo already took that place</li>
  <li>p5p wanted me for something else</li>
  </ul>
<p>What happened is that the list somehow noticed my knowledge of shell
and awk programming (the ol' unix style commands) and that I wasn't scared
of the complexity of Perl's configuration scheme (the Configure script).</p>
<p>Eventually you'll be <i>asked</i> to help out in the (sub)field(s) where
you've proven to have knowledge of or insight in.</p>
<p>Now that Perl6 has taken a serious start, don't think perl5 doesn't need
any more attention. We do still need enthousiastic people to make perl the
language we all want, not scaring away people, but chasing away the bugs.
Start being a list-lurker tomorrow and join perl5-porters next month!</p>
<p>Look throught the TODO list to check if there is an unexplored field
left alone so far that yearns for your attention.</p>
