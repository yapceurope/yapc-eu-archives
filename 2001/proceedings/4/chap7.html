<p>But, but, but .... the code just presented doesn't compile! It does not
even spit out an appropriate error message or some useful diagnostics.
WHY? What is happening here?</p>

<p>Faced with this problem, I had to reduce the problem to a minimum,
something I learned in the past. So I came up with a test case that I
could post to perlbug@perl.org</p>
<pre>
    #!/usr/bin/perl -w

    # use strict;
    # use diagnostics;

    my $e010101 = "Value 1";
    my @e = (0, { 101 => $e010101 });

    format OLD0 =
    @<<<<<<<<<<
    $e010101
    .

    format NEW0 =
    @<<<<<<<<<<
    $e[1]{101}
    .

    format NEW0 =
    @<<<<<<<<<<
    "$e[1]{101}"
    .</pre>

<p>No answers, no patches, no nothing. I was left on my own. What
next?</p>
