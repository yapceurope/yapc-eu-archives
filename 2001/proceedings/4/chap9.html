<h3><a name="resc">Resources and Self-motivation</a></h3>

<p>After digging through the available resources:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Documentation</li>
  <li>Mailing list (archives)</li>
  <li>Change logs</li>
  <li>Source code</li>
  </ul>
<p>I still found no suitable place to start, because there's not much
reference material on formats</p>
<p>There's a lot of discussions on perl5-porters varying from thread
implementations to unicode handling and from string interpolation to
regular expression irregularities, but <b>format</b>'s are not discussed,
so the mailing list archives are not a good resource. So I had to do some
research myself.</p>
<p>Several mails to the mailing list asking for a place to start the
research led to 2 pointers, both proved to be very wrong, because they
assumed the flaw was in the formatting code.</p>
<p>Digging. Learning how to use gdb, which - on a HP-UX platform - proved
to be less than easy. And though perlguts turned out to be a nice manual
for the parts that did not blow up in my face, I had to track down what
was happining, and try to follow the flow that is used when parsing
formats.</p>
<p>After turning the formatting inside out and upside dow, not finding
anything unusual happening, I just added <code>printf</code> statements
haphazardly throughout the perl source code on points where I did expect
the flow to pass by, and printed out some global variables. At this point
intuition turns out to be more valuable than knowledge, cause I almost hit
the right globals from the start.</p>
<p>Realizing a not very well known fact that the variable declaration
within a form definition can span multiple lines if the starting line of
those variable <i>start with</i> a open brace, I was intuitively looking
for places that dealt with that code.</p>
<p>It turned out to be the closing brace <code>}</code> that caused a
reset of a global brace counter when not aware of being inside a format
parsing. I then did a decrement, instead of a reset, to check if I was
right, and the format part now compiled, but other code parts did not.</p>
<p>So the solution was at hand: the trouble spot was detected, but I had
to find a way to <i>detect</i> (or rather <i>know</i>) that at that point
I was inside a format and, if so, decrement, otherwise reset.</p>
