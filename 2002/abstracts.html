<div class="c">by Juan J. Merelo; 2h tutorial
</div><p>I would like to propose a tutorial on evolutionary computation using
Perl, SOAP, and XML. It would be based on my EC Perl module, opeal, at<a href="http://opeal.sourceforge.net/"> &lt;http://opeal.sourceforge.net/&gt; </a>,
and would include the following topics:</p><ol><li>Evolutionary computation at large</li><li>Designing an EC framework in Perl: pros and cons</li><li>Specifying EC problems in XML, reading them in Perl</li><li>Distributing EC problems using SOAP.</li></ol><p>I would go for a 1.5 hour presentation, if there's no time slot
available for tutorials.</p>

; 3h tutorial
</div><p>The slides and details are still linked off the 2001 YAPC
      website or directly at<a href="http://www.criticalintegration.com/gtk-tutorial/"> &lt;http://www.criticalintegration.com/gtk-tutorial/&gt; </a></p><p>Gtk is a graphical toolkit for building X11 based graphical
applications.  This tutorial assumes perl knowledge and is not for
novices.</p><p>The first 20-30 mins or so of the tutorial is a background of Gtk,
why, where and how.  It emphasises the change in style from the more familier
&quot;straight line&quot; programming to the seeming chaotic event-driven programming
which is the fundimental of all Graphical programming.</p><p>The nasties of packing, boxes and getting used to the idea of
giving up control.</p><p>A basic crib-sheet of basic widgets, functions and methods will
be provided.  This I found last year would be vital, as the process of
re-affirming syntax via the slides is too time-consuming.</p><p>Then the fun starts.</p><p>A basic application requirement will be taken from the floor, and
the application will be designed using pen and whiteboard.  The structure
will be explained, pitfalls will be purposefully fallen into to give the
attendee a good basic understanding of how to write (and how not to write)
basic X11 applications.</p><p>Last year, the application was the &quot;Dutch Auction&quot; program
which was used at the end of YAPC::Europe.</p><p>Learning from the tutorial last year... I will be stricter on
answering &quot;pedant&quot; questions like &quot;Why don't you use a foreach loop&quot;
instead of assigning individual assignments. (Readability)</p>

<span class="top"><a name="talk">Talks</a></span>
<h3 class="c">Creepy featurism<a name="creepy">&nbsp;</a></h3><div class="c">by Mark Overmeer
; 45' talk
</div><p>This is about software development: when a tiny feature in a module
      gets implemented in a correct way, this one line of code gets
      encapsulated in subroutines/methods, documentation, tests, etc.
      This is about the difference between &quot;solving my problem&quot;, which
      is the daily practice for writing applications, and &quot;solving your
      problems&quot;, which is required for CPAN modules.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="c">How to Integrate Anything with SOAP<a name="stowe">&nbsp;</a></h3><div class="c">by Jonathan Stowe
; 60' talk
</div><p>SOAP started life as the Simple Object Access Protocol, one
      of the productions of the W3 Consortium's XML Protocol working
      group.  It defined a relatively lightweight means of doing
      Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) using XML over a pre-existing
      network transport protocol.  The 1.2 version of the
      specification somewhat downgraded the acronym SOAP as features
      were added which probably meant that it not quite so Simple
      anymore and the RPC 'Object Access' simply became one of the
      ways in which the protocol be used for communication between
      systems.</p><p>Perl has, for quite some time, had good support both for XML
      processing and for handling a variety of common network
      transport protocols and thus was in a good position from the
      start to be able to provide good support for SOAP and so was
      able to take its deserved reputation as an excellent 'glue
      language' further beyond the boundaries of a single system or
      application than it previously had done and into the arena of
      application integration - previously the preserve of expensive
      and complicated middleware.</p><p>This will talk will include a a brief introduction to the
      history of and the rationale behind SOAP and the reasons why
      Perl was in a good position to be an early language for which a
      toolkit was available to build SOAP applications.</p><p>The remainder of the talk will focus on the use of Perl and
      SOAP in the integration of diverse applications and will include
      discussion of:</p><ul><li>Reusing Perl code in non-Perl
	    applications</li><li>Extending the capabilities of non-Perl
	    applications to do things that are only sensible to write
	    in Perl</li><li>Why I love .NET and BizTalk server even
	    though Microsoft are still bad and
	    evil.</li><li>The choice of Perl SOAP Toolkit and a
	    comparison with some non-Perl ones.</li><li>Why you might want to use the 'Document
	    Style' rather than RPC and how you might do
	    this.</li><li>Why you might not want to look into the
	    inside of SOAP::Lite if you value your sanity
	    :)</li><li>What are &quot;Web Services&quot; and how are they
	    different to SOAP?</li><li>The reason to choose between the various
	    transport mechanisms.</li></ul><p>There will be working examples demonstrated in Perl and C++
      (and possibly C# or Java) although this will be at a higher
      level than a tutorial.</p><p>This should serve both as an introduction to using SOAP with
      Perl for the uninitiated and also as a demonstration to people
      already familiar with it some further ways that it can be
      used.</p>

<h3 class="c">Perl 5.8 At Last<a name="perl5_8">&nbsp;</a></h3><div class="c">by Arthur Bergman
; 45' talk
</div><p>For the past two years Perl 5.8 has been one of the worst hidden
skunkworks ever. Conceived approximately at the same time as the much
publicized Perl 6 project, 5.8 (clandestinely disguised as 5.7) has
made major enhancements to the Unicode functionality, sprouted a new
user-visible threads implementation, silently assimilated several
dozen modules, and created some completely new ones. Other new
features and enhancements include a new stackable IO architecture,
more accurate numbers and arithmetics, restricted hashes, and safe
signals.  Perl 5.8 is also the most thoroughly tested Perl release
ever.</p><p>Come to hear what's new, what's changed, and what's gone.</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="c">Smoking Bleadperl<a name="hmbx">&nbsp;</a></h3><div class="c">by H.Merijn Brand
; 60' talk
</div><p>How many hours a programmer will put in his program, and how
      many bugs he might have solved, and how much of the program is
      covered with working test code, bugs will probably always be
      present in the program or script.</p><p>The most recent development branch of the Perl code is
      called bleadperl, and it is patched by many on several parts on
      a daily basis. For every patch that solves a bug or extends the
      features of the rich language that Perl offers, other
      functionality might get busted or slightly broken.</p><p>Testing the latest state in as many configurations as
      possible on as many operating systems as possible with as many
      development enviroinments as possible is a great source of
      information to the perl5 porters. This process has been called
      ``smoke testing''.</p><h4>Introduction</h4><p>With people working on various parts of the perl core
	simultaniously: threading and variable sharing, IO subsystems,
	reported bugs, formatting, configuration and hints, etc. etc.,
	it is likely that minor changes might break basic features and
	patches liked and accepted by the GNU gcc compiler are
	rejected by other - more rigorously ANSI - C compilers.</p><p>To catch those, it would be good to have every patch tested
      on all supported platforms as soon as possible. But since
      bleading edge perl is a development release, it is likely to be
      far from stable at any point in time, and thus not to be
      installed by the faint of heart. Core dumps are likely to occur
      if a snapshot is released without being tested on a variety of
      configurations.</p><p>Test-Smoke is a package of scripts that enables
      perl5-porters to receive test reports from users that have spare
      CPU cycles and some disk space on their<code>computer(s)</code>and who are willing to spend a
      few minutes in installing the package which then will run a
      number of tests on the most recent bleadperl situation in as
      many configurations as possible.</p><h4>Talk</h4><p>The talk will deal with the development of what has
	evolved to Test-Smoke, currently available on CPAN. It will
	also deal with some differences in compilers, with different
	OS behaviour, and how new users can participate in this
	valuable process.</p><p>As a side step, some of the parts in the perl source tree
      are explained briefly but not profound and not to show what the
      implications might be of what smoke testing detects.</p>

<h3 class="c">POE for Beginners<a name="boumans_2">&nbsp;</a></h3><div class="c">by Jos Boumans
; 90' talk
</div><h4>About POE</h4><p>The following bit is stolen directly off<a href="http://poe.perl.org"> &lt;http://poe.perl.org&gt; </a>(all good things stem from there):</p><p>POE parcels out execution time among one or more tasks, called sessions.
      Sessions multitask through cooperation (at least until Perl's threads become
      mainstream). That is, each session returns execution to POE as quickly as possible
      so it can parcel out time to the next.</p><p>POE includes a high-level component architecture. Components are modular,
      reusable pieces of programs. They perform common, often tedious tasks so programmers
      can work on more interesting things.</p><p>Several POE components have been written to handle client, server, and peer
      networking tasks. Because of them, POE has become a convenient and quick way to
      write multitasking network applications.</p><p>POE supports graphical toolkits such as Tk and Gtk. It is the only Perl
      programming framework that does this. It also supports Curses, HTTP, and other user
      interfaces. POE programs can present multiple user interfaces at once.</p><h4>About the Contents</h4><p>Most of the material I will be using will be based on the
      CPAN-module<code> Acme::POE::Knee </code>, which is a simple module I
      wrote a while ago to demonstrate how the POE kernel dispatches
      events. It shows the behaviour of the 'state machine'
      illustrated as a pony race (or POEny, as we like to call it).
      The second main source of material will come from the likes of
      the POE article, which appeared on perl.com a while ago. The
      actual article can be found here:<a href="http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2001/01/poe.html"> &lt;http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2001/01/poe.html&gt; </a>.
      The article describes how to build a server daemon that
      understands TCP using POE.</p><h4>About the talk</h4><p>This tutorial is aimed at giving a basic understanding  the
      workings of POE, trying to get the audience to understand how to
      use POE and to show them some simple programs (or POEgrams). The
      main obstacle in understanding POE is right at the beginning; it
      introduces many terms, concepts and technology that might take
      some time to wrap your ahead around. This tutorials aims to be
      your guiding light in this process. Once these basics are
      covered, we can go into the appicatins of POE and teach the
      audience how to write POEgrams themselves.</p>

<h3 class="c">Writing secure applications  - Tips, pitfalls and guidelines<a name="secure">&nbsp;</a></h3><div class="c">by Alejandro Ju&#225;rez Robles and Gunnar Wolf Iszaevich
; 60' talk
</div><p>As Perl grows more popular, it also becomes more capable. What started out
      as a modest reporting language can now be found doing practically everything - And
      practically everything nowadays is network-related. Be it simple CGIs, mod_perl
      modules, SOAP services, daemons of all sorts, tailor-made protocols... Everything
      can be easily coded with Perl. However, power comes at a high price. Many people
      unfortunately write highly insecure software - This can backfire on themselves or on
      any other member of the Perl community, as we often share our code. In our talk, we
      present some examples on what to do, what NOT to do, and how to correctly do it when
      doing programming. This guidelines should be applied also to non-network-oriented
      scripts, as they are general enough.</p>

<h3 class="c">Intelligent Autonomous Avatars<a name="jelinek">&nbsp;</a></h3><div class="c">by Richard Jelinek
; 60' talk
</div><p>I'm currently writing on my dissertation in the field of AI. I also
      happen to build up a company called PetaMem, that is supposed to
      commercially &quot;exploit&quot; some of the AI-scientific achievements.</p><p>One core product we're building are IAAs - intelligent autonomous
      avatars. Systems that are able to classify, translate, recognize
      natural language texts. These systems are - of course - implemented in
      Perl.</p><p>I would like to do some presentation/demonstration of these systems on
      YAPC. This should be a 45 to 60min talk and pretty fit your &quot;Perl and

<h3 class="c">CPANPLUS - Beyond CPAN.pm<a name="boumans_1">&nbsp;</a></h3><div class="c">by Jos Boumans
; 45' talk
</div><p>CPANPLUS is a new and flexible method of perl module
      management and installation, using the Comprehensive Perl
      Archive Network.</p><h4>About CPANPLUS</h4><p>CPANPLUS is a new module. It was born in September of 2001,
      after that year's YAPC::EU in response to general unhappiness
      about CPAN.pm. It aims to be a rewrite, and in time a
      replacement of the current CPAN.pm, but in a completely OO
      model, adding features unknown to the current CPAN.pm, such as
      module uninstall, multiple shells and so on. Not in the least,
      it aims to fix various bugs of CPAN.pm as well as being very
      modular in its build setup, thus allowing many plug-ins. For
      example, with a plug-in to the RT bug tracking system, CPANPLUS
      could send in automatic bug reporting in case a module failed to
      install.</p><h4>About the talk</h4><p>I have given the 90 minute talk about CPANPLUS to
      Amsterdam.pm and it was very well received. However, it also
      went into the technical depths of the module and reviewed the
      history of development, as well as covered the basic knowledge
      required to develop new applications using CPANPLUS. Although
      this is very useful information, it's perhaps better suited for
      a BOF session. In short, I could range the talk from 25 minutes,
      covering just the bases for the average user, to 90 minutes,
      covering development, guts, interfaces, features, bugs,
      direction and so on of the module.</p><p>Some more information about the module can be found on the
      project's homepage at:<a href="http://cpanplus.sourceforge.net"> &lt;http://cpanplus.sourceforge.net&gt; </a></p><h4>Contents</h4><p>Depending on how much time I am given, the following topics
      would be discussed:</p><ul><li>Reason for creating CPANPLUS (25)</li><li>Improvements of CPANPLUS vs CPAN.pm (25)</li><li>A short description of the developers of
	  CPANPLUS (45+)</li><li>The user-interface 'Shell' (25)</li><li>Sample usage of 'Shell' (25)</li><li>The script-interface 'Backend' (25+)</li><li>Sample code utilizing 'Backend' (25+)</li><li>The developer-interface 'Internals' (60+)</li><li>The merits of the various interfaces (45+)</li><li>The current developments (45+)</li><li>The future developments (60+)</li><li>How to contribute to the project (60+)</li></ul>

<h3 class="c">When perl is not quite fast enough<a name="speed">&nbsp;</a> - or /sacrificing (?:style|maintainability) on the altar of speed/</h3><div class="c">by Nicholas Clark
; 40' talk
</div><p>There are times when your perl script just isn't fast enough, and the
      &quot;obvious&quot; solutions (find a better algorithm; use Inline; rewrite it in
      another language; etc) are either impractical or politically unacceptable.
      This talk will describe how to find ways to re-write your perl code to
      go significantly faster, trading style and maintainability for speed.
      Serious speed gains are possible, even for already well designed code.
      Examples will include how I made ext/Encode/bin/enc2xs in the perl 5.8
      distribution take significantly less time to deliver the same output.</p><p>This would be a talk mostly about the work behind some of the terse comments
      in enc2xs such as:</p><code># Do the hash lookup once, rather than once per function call. 4% speedup.</code><br><code></code><br><code># Start at the beginning and work forwards through the string to zero.</code><br><code># effectively we are removing 1 character from the front each time</code><br><code># but we don't actually edit the string. [this alone seems to be 14% speedup]</code><br><code># Hence -$pos is the length of the remaining string.</code><br><code></code><br><code># This takes 65.35</code><br><code># map {hex $_} $line =~ /(....)/g</code><br><code># This takes 63.75 (2.5% less time)</code><br><code># unpack &quot;n*&quot;, pack &quot;H*&quot;, $line</code><br><code></code><br><code># Passing 2 extra args each time is 3.6% slower!</code><br>

<h3 class="c">ELEKTRA Peripheral Simulation: A Perl Application Program<a name="elektra">&nbsp;</a></h3><div class="c">by Wolfgang Laun
; 60' talk
</div><h4>Introduction</h4><p>ELEKTRA is the brand name of ALCATEL Austria's electronic railway
      interlocking system, installed on more than 70 sites in three
      countries.  Laboratory testing of the system requires the
      simulation of all the peripheral equipment (points, signals, etc.)
      and their controlling interfaces. This simulation and the related
      test environment has been implemented as a set of Perl programs.</p><h4>Why Perl?</h4><p>Perl 5 was chosen as the implementation language because its
    promise of portability, the rich set of built-in functions and
    library packages and the existence of Perl/Tk. Object orientedness
    was expected to support code reuse.</p><h4>The Programs</h4><p>The simulation of peripheral equipment is done by EPS/Simulation,
    a server program. Instead of interfacing with the actual hardware,
    the ELEKTRA equipment controllers set up socket connections as
    clients to the simulation server. Output commands are passed on to
    the server which distributes them to the appropriate object, where
    an evaluation method computes the reactions. Status changes are
    returned as input to the equipment controller.</p><p>EPS/Interface is another client for EPS/Simulation. It provides a
    graphical user interface showing a canvas map of all trackside
    equipment and featuring popup windows for all elements. User
    interactions permit changes in the states of the elements (e.g.
    occupying or freeing a track section).</p><p>Running regression tests is supported by EPS/Batch, an extensible
    command interpreter. During ELEKTRA system tests it operates as a
    client to EPS/Simulation, using commands for changing element
    states.  Another connection links this program with an ELEKTRA
    node for sending simulated operator inputs on mouse and keyboard
    and for retrieving screen dumps of the ELEKTRA monitors
    documenting the system status.</p><p>Yet another client for EPS/Simulation is EPS/Move, a simple
    program capable of simulating train movements from a start signal,
    following tracks and points until a signal showing halt is
    encountered.</p><p>EPS/Track Editor is an offline tool for drawing canvas maps for
    EPS/Interface.</p><h4>Simulating a Relay Interlocking System</h4><p>Since ELEKTRA is also capable of providing a user interface for
relay-based interlocking systems the simulation provided by
EPS/Simulation also had to include one set of elements
corresponding to those that can be found in a relay interlocking
system. The simulation of this element group includes interlocking
features such as train and shunting route selection and cancellation,
and various operations on points, signals and other equipment.</p><h4>Some Interesting Features</h4><p>Element (i.e. object) states are communicated via sockets. This is done
by sending key-value pairs as plain text, with the receiver eval-ing
them into its copy of the object.</p><p>The considerable number of objects that need to be shown in the GUI
of EPS/Interface is managed by describing each object by its set
of output and input lines and external states. The corresponding
popup-window is generated from this description.</p><p>EPS/Batch uses dynamic loading of code implementing various additional
sets of commands. Thus, EPS/Batch is not only used for ELEKTRA system
tests but also for MMI and equipment controller subsystem tests.
Extension can be written according to a simple command pattern,
using a simple interface provided by the core of EPS/Batch.</p><h4>Conclusion</h4><p>Development began with 5.005_03 on Solaris which turned out to be
very stable and reliable. Later on, 5.6.1 was used (Solaris an Linux),
again without any problems. Using Perl/Tk was difficult at times,
mostly because of the lack of examples for the more advanced features.</p>

<h3 class="c">Case Study: Psychometric Testing with Perl<a name="psychometric">&nbsp;</a></h3><div class="c">by Karen Pauley
; 30' talk
</div><p>Psychometric tests are now a standard part of many
      recruitment processes.  Traditionally these are hand-scored by
      qualified psychologists, at great expense and with a long delay
      between taking the test and getting the results.  We were
      approached by a company who wanted to produce these tests
      on-line, so that companies could get instant results from
      candidates who sit the test.</p><p>They wanted a system that they could use to set up different
      tests for different clients, enter the scoring rules (which
      could be different for different types of tests), and have the
      system produce reports on each candidate who sits the test. This
      was to be web-based and browser-independent, and the 'look and
      feel' of each test should be easily customisable to look like
      each client's own web site.</p><p>And, of course, it had to be completed in several weeks at
      minimal cost.</p><p>In this case study we'll look at:</p><ul><li>What to do when you have to build a system in a hurry.</li><li>Making the CPAN work for you.</li><li>Reducing your workload by 90% by using Class::DBI and Template::Toolkit

</div><p>The National Software Reference Library (NSRL) is designed
      to collect software from various sources and incorporate file
      profiles computed from this software into a Reference Data Set
      (RDS) of information. The RDS can be used by law enforcement,
      government, and industry organizations to review files on a
      computer by matching file profiles in the RDS. This will help
      alleviate much of the effort involved in determining which files
      are important as evidence on computers or file systems that have
      been seized as part of criminal investigations [1]. The
      harvesting of file profiles from software is accomplished by
      multiple computers in a loose parallel computing environment.
      The implementation of the environment is discussed, with
      attention to performance improvements using reverse regular
      expressions known as &quot;sexeger&quot;.</p><p>[1] Fisher, G. (2001) NIST ITL Bulletin, &quot;<a href="http://www.nsrl.nist.gov/itlbulletin.html"> Computer Forensics

; 75' talk
</div><p>Nemo is TeXmacs with Perl. Nem, Niki, Nirc and Nile will be
      the Nemo tool thanks to TeXmacs and Perl.</p><p>TeXmacs is an interactive documentation tool with a power
      comparable to TeX.  It does not include or use any TeX code
      except for font handling, neither emacs code; but, in addition
      to a menu-driven interface, it supports keyboard accelerators in
      a way comparable to emacs but somehow different too because
      TeXmacs has a more complex and (currently) specialized purpose.</p><p>TeXmacs is already used to write complex articles and books
      with complex maths, TOCs, indexes, footnotes... The current main
      hindrance is more sociological than technical, as editors prefer
      to receive Word or TeX documents.</p><p>TeXmacs is GPL, available on Unices with X-windows system.
      It is written in C++, currently uses Guile as an extension
      language and its own widget library.  I have near completed a
      shallow port using Qtapplication event loop that will be quickly
      followed by a shallow Perl embedding including a Qt adaptator
      for POE.  Watch CPAN and look for mQT and POE::Kernel::mQt
      within a week!  After that, a complete port to Qt will be done
      to facilitate port toward non unix-like-systems.  The Perl
      interpreter will eventually have more access to the TeXmacs
      internal structures.</p><p>The Nemo project will eventually culminate in a year or two
      in  Nile (Nemo Interactive Literate Environment) with dynamic
      syntax hiliting that will support languages like per6 with an
      unlimited number of Unicode operators. More,  Nile opens to
      these languages the full expressivness of mathematical notation
      (indices, exponent, matrices...). Think of Nile as literate IDE.</p><p>I will present TeXmacs as seen by users, will move to how to
      a quick review of TeXmacss internal and file format, then will
      explain how to extend TeXmacs using Perl. Finally I will expose
      the basic rudiments behind the upcoming parsing/deparsing engine
      behind Nile, the upcoming interactive literate environment.
      Steps toward Nile will be Nem (concurrent edtions over the net),
      Niki (a wiki), Nirc (a TeXmacs client that supports Math
      Notations).</p><h4>Tentative TOC</h4>

<h3 class="c">How to Build Large Scale Websites/Web Applications With Embperl 2.0<a name="embperl">&nbsp;</a></h3><div class="c">by Axel Beckert
; 45' talk
</div><p>This talk shows how to build large scale websites or web
  applications with Embperl. It discusses the concept of separation of
  application logic, display logic, content and layout and how this
  separation can be achieved with Embperl 2.0.</p><p>First, the talk shows the importance of application objects and how
  they are created, how to break up whole pages into components and
  how Embperl's inheritance model is working and what are its benefits.</p><p>It then continues with a short introduction into Embperl's
  processing pipeline, which allows the creation of component output
  within multiple transformations, giving the possibility to include
  nearly every data source (like e.g. POD, XML, RSS, SSI, CGI scripts
  or plain text) and rendering techniques (like e.g. JSP, ASP or PHP).</p><p>The talk will comprise embedding Perl into HTML, using static XML,
  generating XML dynamically, doing XSLT transformations and using
  XSL-FO to generate HTML, XML, PDF, text and various other output
  formats.</p><p>It will also touch other features being necessary to build large
  scale websites like session handling, caching, database access and
  internationalization.</p><p>This talk will be similar to Gerald Richter's Embperl talk given at
      OSCON 2002. (See<a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2002/view/e_sess/2716"> &lt;http://conferences.oreillynet.com/cs/os2002/view/e_sess/2716&gt; </a>)</p>

<h3 class="c">E-Mail Processing with Perl<a name="mailbox_intro">&nbsp;</a></h3><div 
class="c">by Mark Overmeer - MARKOV Solutions; 45' talk
</div>
<p>In the last few years, e-mail developed from an application used by a
relatively small scientific community into a basic means of
communication for everyone. Companies have added e-mail as a new way
to keep in touch with consumers, next to the traditional postal and
telephone services. Friends post birthday invitations by e-mail, and
the pictures of the last family meeting are broadcasted to everyone on
them.</p>

<p>Creative new practices for e-mail include spam and spreading
viruses. Jokes are not posted in plain text anymore, but preferably as
PowerPoint presentations. Plain text is not nice at all: let's send
HTML or -even better- full Word and PDF documents to everyone we know!</p>

<p>The concept of e-mail has changed, and with it the need to control
that flow has increased. Filters which automatically remove received
spam, virus checkers, and message content converters are more and more
implemented. At the same time, mail folders grow rapidly in size. The
number of messages to read daily explodes.  How to cope with that?</p>

<p>The recently developed Mail::Box module is capable of handling various
kinds of mail folders and replaces many older Perl modules (like
MailTools) with components which are better suited for the current
generation of messages. The module supports many advanced features
which can help implementing the filters you need.</p>

<p>Some features of Mail::Box, Mail::Address, and MIME::Types will be
discussed. A few small programs will be explained. Although Mail::Box
is fully Object Oriented, only little OO is really needed to
understand the examples.</p>

<h3 class="c">Introduction to OO Programming<a name="boumans_3">&nbsp;</a> - There's a method to this madness</h3><div class="c">by Jos 
Boumans
; 45' talk
</div><h4>About the Contents</h4><p>Most of the material I will be using is based on the OO tutorials I wrote,
	which can be found at<a href="http://japh.nu"> &lt;http://japh.nu&gt; </a>I wrote these as a response to many questions on the beginners@perl.org mailinglist.
	  Every day, at least a few questions about OO programming would be asked and many of
	  them would have been answered if the users had read Damian's book or Advanced Perl
	  Programming. When people inquired why they hadn't done so, the majority answered
	  that most concepts introduced in the afore mentioned books were over their head.
	  They wanted a simple yet clear introduction to both the vocabulary and the concept
	  of OO perl.</p><h4>About the talk</h4><p>This tutorial aims to be just that: an introduction to both the vocabulary and
	the concept. It requires only basic perl knowledge, and assumes no knowledge of
	other languages or OO programming in general.
	I will attempt to divide the talk into a few chapters, aimed at not only helping
	the audience understand both concept and vocabulary, but also teaching them how to
	apply this knowledge in their first attempts at their own modules.
	After attending this talk, both Damian's book as well as Advanced Perl Programming
	are recommended literature and should no longer be as elusive.</p>

<h3 class="c">Sex, flies and microarrays<a name="mcwilliam">&nbsp;</a></h3><div class="c">by Lucy McWilliam
; 7' lightning
</div><p>I'm a bioinformatics research student who uses (admittedly, not very
exciting) perl on a daily basis.  Given the 'Science of Perl' theme, I
thought it might be nice to give a simple overview of the (admittedly,
quite funky) biology that perl helps my colleagues and I accomplish.</p>

<h3 class="c">Object::Realize::Later<a name="later">&nbsp;</a></h3><div class="c">by Mark Overmeer
; 7' lightning
</div><p>This is more a 'Damian-style' module, which adds laziness to object
      initiation.  This module redefines AUTOLOAD, isa, can, etc.... it's
      tricky.  This subject may just fit in a lightning-slot, but may be
      way over the head for many.  At the other hand, 30 minutes is a bit
      too much time, I expect.</p>

<h3 class="c">We're not Building a F******g House!<a name="swear">&nbsp;</a></h3><div class="c">by James A Duncan
; 7' lightning
</div><p>This talk comes standard with a wee bit of swearing.  It can be censored
however, but I'd rather do that on the basis of what the audience wants.</p><p>As workers in an industry we keep trying to find a metaphor for what we
do, rather than just explaining it.  We tend to be proud of our
achievements inside our technical community. However outside of that
tight knit group we tend to clam up when it comes to explaining what we
do and how we do it to our friends, families, and random people we meet
while drinking. The metaphor approach is not working. No one outside of
a software background seems to have any understanding of why its hard to
change something six months after the development starts primarily
because they don't understand what it is we do. There are very simple
measures we can and should take as software professionals (more or less)
that attack this problem before it gets any more uncontrollable.</p>

<h3 class="c">WAIT@oreilly.de<a name="wait">&nbsp;</a></h3><div class="c">by Andreas J. K&#246;nig

</div><p><a href="http://www.oreilly.de/catalog/search.html"> &lt;http://www.oreilly.de/catalog/search.html&gt; </a>-<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/wait/"> &lt;http://sourceforge.net/projects/wait/&gt; </a></p><p>The WAIT module is the unsung hero among all full text search engines
for perl programmers. It is a rewrite of the famous freeWAIS-sf
program in perl and XS.</p><p>From freeWAIS-sf it inherits bullet-proof algorithms from academic
information retrieval background. From perl it gets backing in
portability and sophistication. XS contributes speed in time-critical
areas.</p><p><a href="http://www.oreilly.de/catalog/search.html"> &lt;http://www.oreilly.de/catalog/search.html&gt; </a>is a proof-of-concept
mod_perl application that is featuring WAIT and XSLT. When you try it
out, you will notice:<ul><li><p>It's hard to find a query that tells you &quot;No hits&quot;.</p><p>Only two-letter searches may fail. Anything else that doesn't match a
word in the dictionary is handed over to a second-level search engine
through similarly written words.</p></li><li><p>Even if there is no hit, you still get a helpful answer</p><p>Queries that fit no document are turned into digram-searches through
the dictionary of all possible words.</p></li><li><p>Results are sorted well</p><p>Watch the indicator of the relevance ranking for every hit, even for
multiword searches.</p></li><li><p>Not all words of a multiword search must be in the dictionary</p><p>Any of the words in a multiword search may be a miss in the dictionary
and yet the answers make sense. The reason for that is that search
terms are generally ORed together (unlike google).</p></li></ul><p>Other features you might not see on first sight, are full Unicode
support (because this servlet is written for perl 5.8.0) and
incremental indexing and de-indexing (we haven't used this feature at
O'Reilly because we have no control over the changes in the
documents, but you can watch the incremental indexing feature at<a href="http://netlexikon.akademie.de/query"> &lt;http://netlexikon.akademie.de/query&gt; </a>).</p><h4>Source code</h4><p>A working snapshot of the full source code of the O'Reilly servlet is
included in the CVS version of WAIT at sourceforge.net. We would wish
that the publication of the servlet encourages you to hack your own
search engine.</p><h4>Thanks</h4><p>We (Ulrich Pfeifer and me) would like to thank O'Reilly Germany for
giving us the opportunity to experiment with 5.8.0 and WAIT in a
real-world scenario.</p>

<h3 class="c">Lessons from a failed Perl-XS project<a name="brech">&nbsp;</a></h3><div class="c">by Martin Brech; 7' lightning</div>
<ul>
<li>attempting to interface the Lotus Notes C API to Perl
<li>still an interesting thing to do as poor Notes Admins are still lost without a good scripting language, not to
mention data import/export headaches with Notes databases
<li>Lotus Notes is definitely more a Win32 thing even on the server side
<li>Lotus Notes on Win32 needs dealing with threads
<li>right decision for the Perl-XS interface: steal the design of the interface from existing LotusScript class design
<li>wrong ansatz: tried to construct the objects on the C level for speed reasons
</ul>
<p><b>lessons learned:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>for such large APIs (600+ functions and numerous structs) always start with SWIG to get at the Perl
level ASAP
<li>Perl, XS and Win32 has been a really explosive mixture for me and ... booom ... left me shattered in
pieces
