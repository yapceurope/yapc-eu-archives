	<br/>Wednesday, 30th August 2006, The Morgan Stanley Room, 0905, 15 mins
	<p>For those new to the YAPC experience, this short talk explains what you can expect. What IRC is, what IRC channels to listen in on, the wiki, the people and most of all, how you can join in.

	<hr size=1 width="96%" />
	<p><strong>Keynote - Larry Wall</strong>
	<br/>Wednesday, 30th August 2006, The Morgan Stanley Room, 0925, 30 mins

	<p><strong>How to Join the Perl Community - Jos&eacute; Castro</strong>
	<br/>Wednesday, 30th August 2006, The Morgan Stanley Room, 1100, 40 mins
	<p>Discovering the Perl community: use.Perl, Perlmonks, IRC channels and servers, PM groups, conferences, mailing lists and much more. How it all works, how to fit in and how to get the most out of it all.

	<p><strong>CPAN and its tools - domm</strong>
	<br/>Wednesday, 30th August 2006, The Onion Room, 1100, 40 mins
	<p>I&#39;ll take a very close look on CPAN and its tools. The talk is aimed at CPAN beginners to intermediate users, though pros should also learn a thing or two.<ul> <li>CPAN itself <ul> <li>what various files (02packages.details.txt.gz, ..) do <li>tools to work with those files (Parse::CPAN::*) <li>history </ul> <li>PAUSE <ul> <li>how to get an account <li>upload/delete stuff </ul> <li>Installation of dist using CPAN.pm and CPANPLUS (very brief) <li>mirroring (rsync, CPAN::Mini) <li>search.cpan.org <li>BackPAN <li>CPAN Testers <li>RT <li>CPAN Forum and Ratings <li>AnnoCPAN <li>CPANTS <li>future of CPAN (6PAN, FreePAN, ..) </ul> <ul> <li>Bonus Material (targeted at authors): <ul> <li>dist layout <li>dist housekeeping (Module::Build etc) <li>META.yml </ul> </ul><p>I think that a lot of CPAN-releated info is hidden in some mailing lists and only known to a certain few people. One goal of my talk is to collect this knowledge and make it more easily accessable - heh, now the talk even fits to the conference theme :-)

	<hr size=1 width="96%" />

	<p><strong>The Inaccessability of Perl - Stray Toaster</strong>
	<br/>Wednesday, 30th August 2006, The Morgan Stanley Room, 1145, 20 mins
	<P>Cursed with explaining to systems engineers why their perl4 sucks? Doomed to decoding some built-up-over-the-years regex that runs to 300 characters? Fated to forever wander to THE FAR SIDE OF THE OFFICE to fix other people's scripts? Why is perl so damned inaccessible? This is the true story of an innocent abroad, one who was brought up with Proper Perl, then released into the full horror of the Real World(tm). With examples, video nasties and primal scream therapy, this is a jaunt through perl through the eyes of others viewed by me, fixed by me and screamed at by me.

	<hr size=1 width="96%" />
	<p><strong>Sorry, you're not my type - Jonathan Worthington</strong>
	<br/>Wednesday, 30th August 2006, The Onion Room, 1145, 20 mins
	<P>Type systems are useful because they allow us to turn down bad programs either at compile time, run time or a combination of the two. In this talk I'll give a quick tour of some key aspects of typing, using simple examples to cut through the maze of jargon. I'll spend some time discussing the type system in Perl 6, which will be somewhat richer than that of Perl 5. While you can write Perl 6 without caring much about typing, just as in Perl 5, this talk will explain why you might want to think about types a bit more.<P>OUTLINE <ul> <li>What the heck are types and type systems, anyway? <li>What do type systems provide? <li>Why can type systems be bad? <li>Visiting the terminology zoo: static vs. dynamic typing, strong vs. weak typing, duck typing, hybrid type systems, type inference, type checking <li>Polymorphism <ul> <li>What is it all about? <li>Subtyping (through "subclassing") <li>Parametric polymorphism </ul> <li>Refinement types <li>Wrap-up, where to look to learn more <li>Questions </ul>

	<p><strong>How to get IRC addicts pay attention to your talk - domm</strong>
	<br/>Wednesday, 30th August 2006, The Morgan Stanley Room, 1210, 20 mins
	<p>During the German Perl Workshop, Michael Kr&ouml;ll (PEPL) and me hacked together a quick and dirty way to get the attention of all those &quot;attendees&quot;, who use conferences mainly for uninterrupted IRCing.<p>We wrote an IRC-Bot that posts the content of my slides to an IRC channel.<p>In this half funny, half technical talk I will present the problem and our solution to it. Which involves JavaScript/AJAX, CGI-scripting, FIFOs and writing an IRC bot.

	<p><strong>Perl Eye for the Ruby Guy - Adrian Howard</strong>
	<br/>Wednesday, 30th August 2006, The Onion Room, 1210, 20 mins
	<p>A brief look at Ruby from the perspective of a Perl coder. What&#39;s similar, what&#39;s different. Ways you can play with &quot;the Ruby way&quot; in Perl 5 and Perl 6. Aimed at Perl coders who have heard about Ruby and what to know what all the fuss is about. Very much /not/ an advocacy &quot;my language is better than your language&quot; talk.

	<p><strong>Perl Hacks You May Not Know - chromatic</strong>
	<br/>Wednesday, 30th August 2006, The Morgan Stanley Room, 1400, 40 mins
	<p>Perl is a rich language with decades of history. Unlike other languages that revel in oversimplicity, Perl has dark and hidden corners that reward careful programmers willing to experiment and play.<p>Why should you have to devote yourself to years of study to find them? Why not skip ahead in your education and learn a few weird and wonderful features waiting for you to tame and use them to solve difficult and fun problems? chromatic will demonstrate at least five Perl hacks you probably don&#39;t know about. It&#39;s up to you to use them productively.<p>Additional information: I plan to take three of the hacks from the book. I do have some new ideas about some of the hacks, so there will be new material. I also hope to show off at least one of user-defined pragmas, improved coderef-in-@INC, and using C libraries without a compiler.

	<p><strong>Introduction to Parrot - Leopold T&ouml;tsch</strong>
	<br/>Wednesday, 30th August 2006, The Onion Room, 1400, 20 mins
	<P>Parrot is a virtual machine intended to mainly run dynamic languages, especially Perl6.<P>The talk summarizes Parrot basics from its origin, its overall structure, major parts, to its most distinguished features.

	<hr size=1 width="96%" />
	<p><strong>Advanced Databases for Beginners - Dave Cross</strong>
	<br/>Wednesday, 30th August 2006, The Camel Room, 1400, 180 mins
	<P>Everyone knows how to use databases right? You just create a few tables and bung some data in them. Later on you can select the data back again or update it.<P>Well, that's only really half the picture. And many people only see that half of the picture. Which is why so many database designs are so bad.<P>In this tutorial, we'll look at the bits of database design that most people seem to forget about. We'll learn some techniques that can make your databases more robust, easier to use and perhaps even faster.<P>Amongst the topics we'll cover are: <ul> <li>Normalisation <li>Data types <li>Constraints <li>Indexes <li>Relationships <li>Triggers </ul><P>All of the examples will be based on MySQL 5 but the principles will be application to most database systems.

	<p><strong>Catalyst/DBIx::Class BOF - Matt S Trout</strong>
	<br/>Wednesday, 30th August 2006, The Shadowcat Room, 1400, 180 mins
	<P>Basically, it'd be nice if we could steal a room for a few hours at some point. The two projects share enough committers I think the best bet would be to have it be a sort of general thing so whoever turns up and has the time can come in - also I can do some running down of roadmaps and plans and we can discuss in more detail who's going to get volunteered for what.

	<p><strong>Parrot Specials - Leopold T&ouml;tsch</strong>
	<br/>Wednesday, 30th August 2006, The Onion Room, 1420, 20 mins
	<P>Parrot is a virtual machine intended to mainly run dynamic languages, especially Perl6. This talk is covering some more advanced Parrot features including lexical variable handling and closures, OO-support, multimethod dispatch, the Parrot Grammar Engine (PGE) and more.

	<p><strong>Accessible applications in Perl - Jouke Visser</strong>
	<br/>Wednesday, 30th August 2006, The Morgan Stanley Room, 1445, 20 mins
	<p>This talk will introduce the audience in how to get started if they want to create accessible applications in Perl.<p>I will speak from my own experience, since I&#39;ve been working on this subject for the past 5 years, creating pVoice and other accessible programs. End-users, specifically disabled users, aren&#39;t developers. They are not interested in the programming language we all love, nor in installing dozens of modules to get them to start the application. They need a solution for a specific problem. It&#39;s your task as a developer to hide the complexity of all of this, and think about functionality. Not an easy task for the average geek ;-)

	<p><strong>The Parrot Compiler Tools - Allison Randal</strong>
	<br/>Wednesday, 30th August 2006, The Onion Room, 1450, 40 mins
	<P>The core of the Parrot compiler tool suite is the fuel-injected dual-turbine of PGE and TGE, Parrot's parser and tree transformation engines. While these tools have their roots in regular expressions, recursive descent parsing, and attribute grammars, they are so far beyond these dusty archaic fields of study that they have been called "revolutionary".<P>This talk is a tour through some of the languages currently being implemented on Parrot (APL, Scheme, Perl 1, and Perl 6) and the tools that make them possible. You'll walk away from it secure in the knowledge that your horizons have been expanded like a slice of lemon wrapped around a large gold brick. Who knows, you might even be be bitten by a suspiciously compelling urge to implement a language on Parrot.

	<p><strong>Searching With Perl - Kevin Falcone</strong>
	<br/>Wednesday, 30th August 2006, The Morgan Stanley Room, 1510, 20 mins
	<p>In the last few years, several new searching modules for Perl have come into being. These challengers have risen to provide some choices other than Plucene, which was the only option for a long time. Kinosearch and Search::Xapian approach the same problem set with new techniques. CLucene and Lucene attempt to provide a similar set of functionality as Plucene but be much much faster.<p>Speed isn&#39;t the end all and be all of searching, but it is important. In this talk I&#39;ll compare indexing and searching over my corpus, but I&#39;ll also consider the more mundane tasks of programming with the library you&#39;ve chosen. Some common things (filtering what is indexed, highlighting results, finding relevance) have very different techniques depending on the library you choose. Hopefully some sample code and results of the benchmarks will help people in choosing what modules to build their application around.

	<p><strong>My First CPAN Module - Marty Pauley &amp; Karen Pauley</strong>
	<br/>Wednesday, 30th August 2006, The Onion Room, 1600, 60 mins
	<P>So you've heard lots of people talk about this CPAN thing but you aren't really sure what it's for or how to get your work onto it.<P>This tutorial will cover the basics of:<ul> <li>what's CPAN <li>how to use it <li>how to upload your modules <li>how to submit patches </ul>

	<p><strong>Testing the Test::Class way - Adrian Howard</strong>
	<br/>Wednesday, 30th August 2006, The Morgan Stanley Room, 1705, 20 mins
	<P>Introduction to the xUnit / Test:Class style of testing. The Test::Class origin story: the refactoring of some large Perl test suites. Compare and contrast Test::Class to other Perl xUnit implementations. Compare and contrast xUnit with other styles (procedural, declarative, etc.) Not /the/ way - just another way. Introduction to the new features of the next/latest [depending whether I get off my arse and finish it off] Test::Class release (tagged test methods, ability to arbitrary test methods in arbitrary orders.)

	<p><strong>Lithp - Marty Pauley</strong>
	<br/>Wednesday, 30th August 2006, The Onion Room, 1705, 20 mins

	<br/>Thursday, 31st August 2006, The Morgan Stanley Room, 0900, 40 mins
	<p>A quick overview of the main used tools for parsers generation in Perl. How easy they are to use and how efficient they are. The talk will focus on Parse::RecDescent, YAPP+Perl for simplicity and YAPP+Flex for efficiency.

	<hr size=1 width="96%" />
	<p><strong>Net::Proxy, making the network accessible - BooK</strong>
	<br/>Thursday, 31st August 2006, The Onion Room, 0900, 40 mins
	<p>Net::Proxy provides accessibility for those who find that there are too many firewalls and hurdles on the way of their network packets.<p>It can be used to bypass firewalls, setup several TCP services on the same port (magic!), add TLS support to servers which do not support it, etc.<p>I will go into details about the generic Net::Proxy architecture and the concept of connectors, how to use it, and how to create new connectors. The peak being running two distinct TCP services on the same port, transparently.

	<p><strong>Testing Web Applications - Paul Johnson</strong>
	<br/>Thursday, 31st August 2006, The Morgan Stanley Room, 0945, 20 mins
	<p>Testing web applications can be a tricky business. As web applications get more complex, their testing becomes more difficult. especially if they are buzzword compliant and full of dynamic AJAXy goodness.<p>This talk will look at some strategies for testing rich web applications, focuses primarily on WWW::Mechanize and Selenium. In particular we will look at Selenium&#39;s Remote Control mode, using Perl to drive the testing.<p>Selenium is a fairly new tool which is still in a state of rapid development. It allows web applications to be tested by running JavaScript in the browser itself, ensuring that you are testing exactly what the browser will run and saving you from having to deal with the application&#39;s JavaScript directly.

	<p><strong>Why Web Services Are Painful In Perl And Why We Should Care - Jonathan Stowe</strong>
	<br/>Thursday, 31st August 2006, The Onion Room, 0945, 20 mins
	<p>This is a further episode in my ongoing mumble about web services.<p>Because of Perl&#39;s dynamic nature it makes it rather difficult to share &quot;objects&quot; with web services made in different languages. The web services toolkits that we have available in Perl don&#39;t make it easy to understand web services messages from services or clients written in different languages either.<p>WSDL (Web Service Description Language) is a mechanism to enable interoperability between systems without prior knowledge of the underlying architecture providing the service. Whilst now we can work around the difficulty in mapping the &quot;types&quot; described in a WSDL document, largely by ignoring it, if Perl is to have a part in the SOA (service oriented architecture) plans, that the major software vendors are setting forth, then it will need to interoperate more strongly with the systems that currently support these standards.<p>The understanding of WSDL and the accurate passing of document/literal messages is mandated by a number of recent and important standards such as BPEL (business process execution language) and up coming WS- orchestration standards.<p>The talk will discuss the ways that Perl currently fails to support the de facto standards and the reasons for this, and will go on to sketch out how this lack might be fixed. In passing the reason that REST and other ad-hoc &quot;standards&quot; do not fill the ticket will be discussed.

It enables people who have very limited possibilities to operate a computer (or any device for that matter) and who can&#39;t speak themselves, to communicate. Users can select images that are displayed on the screen to form sentences, and once they&#39;re done they can let the computer pronounce it using a Speech Synthesizer.

	<br/>Thursday, 31st August 2006, The Camel Room, 1100, 90 mins
	<p>This talk shows a demonstration of a simple POE project: an IRC bot that is extended to include some very special functionality that turns the audience into a dynamic DNS zone, thus welcoming the audience to join in the fun with their laptops (a substantial portion of the people in the audience will be chatting on irc anyway, so why not try and drag them into the Talk some more by allowing some interaction).<p>The talk explains the big, easy stuff first: POE Components, and sets you smack in the middle of the POE universe. Only after those basics are covered, do we dive into some nitty-gritty detail that delves down to low-level POE stuff like Drivers, Wheels and Filters.<p>This introduction is intended for everyone that has no or only little prior knowledge of POE, but contains a few gems that makes it interesting for the more advanced users (like a UDP SendRecv Driver :).<p>I will then also describe POE signalling some more, using time-out mechanisms as an example, and give some in-depth examples and explanation of the most commonly used POE modules, such as P::W::SocketFactory, P::W::Run, P::C::Client::TCP and P::C::Server::TCP, and P::Filter::Line. <p>I originally held a first version of this talk at the Dutch Perl Workshop, with example code available online at: <a href="http://www.xs4all.nl/~johnpc/Talks/POE_DPW2006/">http://www.xs4all.nl/~johnpc/Talks/POE_DPW2006/</a>

	<p>With Perl6 far underway, it is time to look at all kinds of tools which surround Perl5. Some of them will certainly need an overhaul to facilitate the new language&#39;s needs. Probably the most important reason for people to prefer Perl over other languages is CPAN. What are the needs for CPAN to support Perl6?<p>In their quest for the new requirements, Mark and Sam discoved the limitations of the CPAN system; battles over name-spaces, weak authentication, and Perl5 dependencies, to name just a few. So they started designing CPAN&#39;s follow-up.<p>CPAN6 is meant to preserve the best of CPAN: simple to contribute new software, simple to install modules. At the same time, with CPAN6 everyone can start their own CPAN-like archive, for any programming language. CPAN6 is a meta-archiving infrastructure, which has no equivalent yet. The current CPAN can smoothly fit in as a single instance of an archive, within the CPAN6 framework.

	<p>I want to talk about a module I&#39;ve written called SNMP::Effective. What makes this module special is that it can query a lot of hosts at the same time. It relies on SNMP to do the queries, so the module itself is just to control when to send the SNMP-queries. I will not go in-depth, but talk about the obstacles that occurred while developing it, its main methods, how to call it, and how to retrieve the results from the hosts. The reason I wrote it was that I need a really fast library to get data from cable-modems. There can be quite a lot of hosts in such a network, so therefore speed is a necessity. I would like to present the module, since someone might have the same need as I.

	<p><strong>Perl on MVS/USS and the Art of SWIFT-Message Handling - Bernd Ulmann</strong>
	<br/>Friday, 1st September 2006, The Camel Room, 0945, 20 mins
	<p>SWIFT is the worldwide inter-bank-communication-network - nearly every transaction spanning banks is handled by SWIFT-messages. These messages have a very clumsy format which is indeed hard to parse. There are numerous commercial solutions for the generation and parsing of SWIFT messages but these are normally very expensive and do not necessarily integrate well into every environment.<p>We decided to develop our own solution for the generation of several SWIFT-message formats as well as the parsing of some other types. Therefore we decided to run Perl on our Mainframe (it seems that we are one of the very, very few shops doing this in a production environment and we encountered quite a lot of problems with Perl in an EBCDIC-environment which are partially still unresolved).<p>This turned out to be a good decision - due to Perl we were able to write a prototype parser for so called MT541/3-messages in a single, whereas external sources claim to need one to two man months using Java. :-) We now have a solution which is running in production mode and processes incoming SWIFT-messages, representing trades worth several 10 to 100 million Euros a day.<p>This solution is far ahead of most commercial packages and is easily extendable. Without the decision to run Perl on the Mainframe (which made some problems without &quot;hosties&quot;, who always are quite afraid of new technologies on &quot;their&quot; mainframe), we would not have been able to accomplish the project&#39;s time and performance goals at all.

	<p><strong>logicShop - jonasbn</strong>
	<br/>Friday, 1st September 2006, The Onion Room, 1010, 20 mins
	<p>Level: Introductory-intermediate<p>This is a presentation of the primary product of the evolving micro-ISV logicShop.<p>logicShop is an open source e-commerce platform implemented using Perl and PostgreSQL. Its aim is managing the complexity of products, price strategies and customers and all of the aspects involved in, and required by, a modern e-commerce/web-shop solution.<p>logicShop provides all the basic functionality required by an online shopping platform at the same time it addresses a few aspects and special cases using a flexible data model and the power of Perl. The platform, in its current implementation, has been implemented using Class::DBI and several other CPAN modules. Front-ends are being implemented in several different frameworks, Catalyst being one of them.<p>This paper will not go through all of the implementation of logicShop, but will focus on some of the special cases and their implementations.<ul> <li>Flexible customer datamodel, model and object mapping. <li>Integration toward logicstic and day-to-day business via a rule-based back-end. <li>Controlling presentation from the model. <li>Architecture, views and tables. <li>Prices, currencies and taxes. <li>Controlling business-logic from the model. <li>The intelligent cart. </ul> <p> logicShop is the flagship product in logicLAB and integrates with several other products in the logicLAB portfolio.

	<p><strong>Barely Legal XXX Perl - Jos Boumans</strong>
	<br/>Friday, 1st September 2006, The Onion Room, 1100, 40 mins
	<p>This is the successor of the talk &#39;20 things you might not know about perl&#39;, which has been given at several other conferences and proved quite successful. So by popular demand here is its follow up. <p> The talk shows several features of perl you might not have known that existed, which are being (ab)used to run a program that was designed never to be able to run in the first place... It&#39;s a high paced, humorous and entertaining look at Perl&#39;s slightly less obvious features.

	<p><strong>A Month of Getopt: 31 Modules in 20 Minutes - Aaron Crane</strong>
	<br/>Friday, 1st September 2006, The Morgan Stanley Room, 1120, 20 mins
	<P>There are (at least) 31 distributions in CPAN's Getopt::* namespace - one for every day of the month. Which should you use? Choosing one involves examining all of the available modules in some depth, so you'll be glad to hear that I've done all that work for you. This is a breakneck-pace romp through all of the Getopt modules, looking at why you might want to pick one of them over all the others. Expect to be surprised by the conclusions!

	<p><strong>Interviewing Perl Programmers - Smylers</strong>
	<br/>Friday, 1st September 2006, The Morgan Stanley Room, 1145, 20 mins
	<p>Interviewing for Perl Vacancies: Tips for Grilling Job Applicants<p>&quot;It takes one to know one&quot;, apparently. But if you&#39;re trying to recruit another Perl programmer, how do you determine whether an applicant is up to the task? Being a Perl hacker means you often have to play a part in job interviews, despite likely having no experience of interviewing. This talk aims to help with that.<p>It covers:<ul> <li>musings on job vacancy descriptions. <li>things to look out for on a CV, both good points and &#39;red flags&#39;. <li>testing candidates -- suggestions for written and practical tests, what does and doesn&#39;t work in testing, how to conduct tests. <li>guidelines for posing pertinent questions at applicants, and evaluating their answers. </ul><p>This talk is specifically about recruiting Perl programmers, not just IT recruitment in general: it considers what are the distinguishing characteristics of a Perl hacker, and how best to spot these.

	<p><strong>rsnapshot, a remote filesystem snapshot utility based around perl and rsync - David Cantrell</strong>
	<br/>Friday, 1st September 2006, The Onion Room, 1145, 20 mins
	<p>rsnapshot is a filesystem snapshot utility for making backups of local and remote systems. Using rsync and hard links, it is possible to keep multiple, full backups instantly available. The disk space required is just a little more than the space of one full backup, plus incrementals.<p>In the talk I&#39;ll probably cover: <ul> <li>history of rsnapshot, <li>why you might want to use it, <li>who else uses it, <li>why you might not want to use it, <li>how it works: <ul> <li>hard links, <li>perl as wrapper and glue; </ul> <li>design choices, in particular external dependencies, <li>problems we&#39;ve found. </ul>
