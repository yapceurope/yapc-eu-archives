<h1>How to get to the ICA</h1>

<p>The ICA main entrance in Pall Mall officially opens to the public at 11:00am 
  - obviously for the duration of the conference we need to get attendees in earlier 
  than that.</p>
<p>People need to come to the back entrance of the ICA which is located in Carlton 
  House Terrace to get into the conference each morning.</p>
<p>Once the main doors open people will be able to get in or out through either 
  entrance.</p>
<p>The <a href="graphics/location.gif">attached image</a> shows the location of 
  the back entrance.</p>
<p>On the first morning when people register they'll be given a name badge it's 
  vital that people keep hold of it as without security staff will not let people 
  wander in and out of the building. </p>
