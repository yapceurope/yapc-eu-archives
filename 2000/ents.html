<h1>Suggested / planned entertainment</h1>
<p><i>(so far):</i></p>
<h4>Thursday</h4>
<p>We are meeting at the Pendrells Oak, High Holborn (the regular haunt of <a href="http://london.pm.org/">london.pm</a>) 
  in the Cellar Bar at 7pm.</p>
<h4>Friday</h4>
<p><a href="mailto:dave%5Bat%5Ddave.org.uk">Dave Cross</a> has volunteered to 
  take a party of people down to comfort-computer (<a href="http://www.comfort-computer.org">http://www.comfort-computer.org</a> 
  for more explaination). He suggests that interested parties meet me in the ICA 
  bar at about 17:00 and we'll take the tube there.</p>
<p>Also on offer is a sushi meal and a visit to the <a href="http://www.live2000.com/">Live2000</a> 
  event (5pm). We hope to have sign up forms available...</p>
<h4>Saturday: Pub crawl</h4>
<p>I'm (<a href="mailto:dave%5Bat%5Ddave.org.uk">Dave Cross</a>) in the process 
  of writing up exactly what we'll be doing on Saturday, but it'll be a cultural/historical/alcholic 
  stroll thru Southwark.
<p>I suggestthat people meet me at the ticket barrier of Southwark tube station 
  (Jubilee Line) at 19:00.
<p>British pubs close at 11pm (well, they stop serving then and you get thrown 
  out at some point during the next half hour) and we'll be finishing near London 
  Bridge where there are Jubilee and Northern Line tubes as well as a taxi rank.
<p>I've deliberately chosen a pub crawl route which takes us thru an area of great 
  historical and cultural interest. There's very little chance that anyone not 
  drinking will have a chance to get bored. I think it'll be Saturday night (23rd). 
  Things of interest on the route include: 
<ul>
  <li> Tate Modern (the old Bankside Power Station)</li>
  <li>The Wibbly Wobbly (sorry I mean 'Millennium') Bridge</li>
  <li>The recreation of the Globe Theatre</li>
  <li>The site of the original Globe Theatre (if I can remember where it is!)</li>
  <li>The site of the tavern that the Canterbury Tales starts from</li>
  <li>A recreation of the Goldern Hinde</li>
  <li>Southwark Cathedral</li>
  <li>Borough Market</li>
  <li>The ruins of the Bishop of Westminster's Palace</li>
  <li>The site of the original Clink prison</li>
  <li>The only pub in London owned by the National Trust (that's 'Trust' not > 
    > 'Front'!)</li>
</ul>
